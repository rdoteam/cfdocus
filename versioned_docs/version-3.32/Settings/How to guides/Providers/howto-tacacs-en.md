# How to manage TACACS servers

TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System) is a remote authentication protocol to communicate information between a network server and a client. Originally developed by Cisco Systems, the protocol controls access to terminals and network services, allowing system administrators to restrict user command options. TACACS allows passwords to be managed centrally, which is ideal for systems that access many network devices.

senhasegura allows you to use TACACS servers to authenticate yourself simply by configuring them within your senhasegura instance.

## Register a new server

1. On senhasegura, in the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **Settings**.
2. In the side menu, select **Authentication > Tacacs > Servers**.

   2. **Port**: port on which your TACACS server is listening.
   3. **Enabled**: select Yes to register your server as active in senhasegura.
   4. **Secret key**: your TACACS server's secret key.
   5. **Timeout(s**): Enter the timeout time that senhasegura will wait for a response from the TACACS server.
   6. **Max attempts**: enter the maximum number of attempts that senhasegura will make on the TACACS server.
5. Click on **Save**.

## Edit a server
