# How to register a multi-factor authentication (MFA) provider

Registering a multi-factor authentication (MFA) provider is a crucial step in strengthening the security of information systems and ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and critical resources. MFA adds an extra layer of protection to the authentication process, requiring users to provide two or more verification factors before granting access to systems. This approach combines something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a security token or smartphone app), and sometimes something the user has (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition).

## Requirements

* Having the role of System Administrator.
