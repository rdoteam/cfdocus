# How to manage RADIUS servers

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a network protocol that offers centralized authentication and authorization services for users connecting to and using a network resource. Thus, the RADIUS protocol becomes an alternative to consider when discussing system security, since it allows user credentials to be managed centrally, making it easier to implement strict security policies. senhasegura allows you to use RADIUS servers, all you have to do is configure them within your senhasegura instance.
