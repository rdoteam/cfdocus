# About identity governance and administration (IGA) providers

Identity governance and administration (IGA) providers are platforms or systems that manage digital identities and user access rights in an organization. Their main objective is to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the appropriate resources at the right time and in accordance with established security policies.

Some of the main functionalities of these IGA systems include creating, maintaining and deactivating user accounts, managing passwords, roles and groups, and monitoring and auditing access to resources.

IGA providers are, therefore, essential for maintaining business information security and regulatory compliance.
