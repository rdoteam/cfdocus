# About CI/CD

CI/CD, or Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, is an approach to software development that aims to automate and optimize the software delivery process. Continuous Integration involves developers' frequent code integration into a shared repository, followed by automated testing to ensure early detection of problems. Continuous Delivery extends this by automating software delivery to the production environment efficiently, allowing for continuous and rapid updates.

Within the senhasegura platform, in the **DevOps Secret Manager (DSM)**, in the CI/CD option, you'll find information such as variables and deploys intercepted by senhasegura through integrations with tools such as GitLab, GitHub, Azure, DevOps, Jenkins, among others.

This information helps identify secrets that are being used by applications but are not being managed by senhasegura DSM.
