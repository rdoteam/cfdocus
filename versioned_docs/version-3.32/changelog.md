## ⚙ Changelog per Product

### PAM - Credential Management

#### Product Updates

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| 2571 | Implemented automatic generation of the `identifier` field based on UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) ​​in the Additional Settings tab of the credential. If the user does not inform the `identifier` when creating the credential, the system will create a unique identifier automatically. The generated value can be modified later. |

#### New Feature

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| 2060 | Fixed the behavior of access groups that previously did not correctly consider the sequence of approver levels, allowing the registration of approvers with levels out of order (1, 2, and 3). A validation was added that now prevents the access group from being saved if the approver levels do not follow the correct sequence. For example, it is only allowed to have approvers at levels 1 and 3 with an approver at level 2. |
