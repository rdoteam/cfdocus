# About senhasegura

## **Introduction**

Welcome to senhasegura! This guide will help you get started with understanding what senhasegura is, its purpose, and the various modules and products it offers to safeguard your organization's privileged access.

## **What is senhasegura?**

senhasegura is a comprehensive Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution designed to protect organizations from cyberattacks originating from privileged account abuse and data theft. By securing these high-privilege accounts, senhasegura helps prevent unauthorized access, misuse, and internal threats, ensuring your organization’s security and compliance.

## **Purpose and importance**

Privileged accounts, often with administrative or elevated permissions, are valuable targets for cyberattacks. senhasegura ensures these accounts are safeguarded against unauthorized access, misuse, and internal threats. With a robust set of features, it effectively manages high-privileged accounts, ensures credential security, monitors access to assets, and enforces segregation of duties. This comprehensive approach allows organizations to stay compliant with regulations, minimize security risks, and enforce secure processes efficiently.

## **How senhasegura works**

### **Core concepts**

Understanding the core concepts behind senhasegura is crucial for leveraging its full potential in protecting your organization’s privileged accounts. These concepts form the foundation of senhasegura’s PAM solution and ensure secure, controlled, and monitored access to critical systems.

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** ensures that privileged accounts are protected and their access is controlled and monitored.
- **Credential Vaulting:** the practice of securely storing and managing credentials to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Session Monitoring and Recording:** real-time tracking and recording of privileged sessions to ensure accountability.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** granting permissions based on user roles to minimize unauthorized access.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:** temporarily grants privileged access, which is automatically revoked after a certain period.

### **Modules and components overview**

The senhasegura solution is built on a robust architecture designed to enhance the security, scalability, and efficiency of Privileged Access Management (PAM). The additional modules and components of the product suite further improve security across various areas. The suite includes:

### **Privileged account and session management**

- **PAM Core:** secure repository for storing and managing credentials.
- **Domum Remote Access:** mediates and monitors user sessions to sensitive systems.
- **MySafe:** provides monitored access to databases, ensuring secure DBA activities.

### **Privilege elevation and delegation management**

- **Go Endpoint Manager for Windows:** manages privileged access on Windows endpoints.
- **Go Endpoint Manager for Linux:** manages privileged access on Linux endpoints.
- **Go Endpoint Manager for MacOS:** manages privileged access on MacOS endpoints.
- **Go AD Bridge Manager:** facilitates integration with Active Directory for unified access management.

### **Secrets management**

- **DSM - DevOps Secret Manager:** securely manages secrets and credentials for DevOps environments.

### **Multi cloud**

- **CIEM - Cloud Entitlements Manager:** manages cloud entitlements securely.
- **Cloud IAM:** ensures secure identity and access management in cloud environments.

### **Certificate lifecycle management**

- **Certificate Manager:** oversees the lifecycle of digital certificates to ensure secure communications.

### **Privileged infrastructure**

- **Load Balancer:** distributes network or application traffic to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Crypto Appliance:** provides hardware-based cryptographic operations to secure sensitive data.

By leveraging senhasegura's powerful modules and components, your organization can ensure secure, monitored, and compliant privileged access management, reducing the risk of cyber threats and enhancing overall security posture.

## **Workflow**

The workflow in senhasegura is designed to provide a secure and efficient way to manage privileged access. Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Login:** Users authenticate via multi-factor authentication to access senhasegura.
2. **Access Request:** users request access to specific resources based on their roles and permissions.
3. **Approval:** requests are reviewed and approved by authorized personnel if elevated permissions are needed.
4. **Credential Retrieval:** approved users securely retrieve credentials from the Credential Vault.
5. **Session Proxy:** user sessions are mediated through the Session Proxy to ensure secure access and monitoring.
6. **Activity Monitoring:** all activities are monitored and recorded for auditing purposes.
7. **Logout:** users log out, and any temporary permissions granted during the session are revoked.
8. **Audit and Reporting:** administrators can review session recordings, change logs, and user activity reports to ensure compliance and security.
