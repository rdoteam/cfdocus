User Groups is a feature in senhasegura that associates users with common permissions, linking them to an access group as a group instead of just adding individual users. This makes the experience of using senhasegura products even more fluid and intuitive.

## Requirements

- Access the "User Management" section in the "senhasegura" platform.
- Admin credentials with permissions to create or modify users and groups
