Controlling access to a security system is necessary to prevent unauthorized access to privileged credentials, assets, and other sensitive information stored on the system.

The "Reports" section allows you to print log reports of user and group activities performed through senhasegura. These logs include information such as the date of the action, credentials and user access, and more.

To access these reports, navigate to the "Reports ➔ Access Control" menu, where you will find the following reports:

## **Access control**

This report shows the access control history of the activities made by each system user and the approvals requirements when needed. This report is essential to understand if the privileges of each user are still in compliance with the access flow set by the company's ***policy.*** Also, it informs if the users need approval or not to execute activities.

The **Access control logs** report will print the following information:

- ***Date:*** day and time the change was performed;
