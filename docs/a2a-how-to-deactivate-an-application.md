This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step on how to deactivate a previously created application in the **A2A** module.

## Requirements

## Deactivate an application

1. On the senhasegura platform, in the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **A2A**.
2. In the side menu, select **Applications**.
3. From the list, locate the application you want to deactivate.
4. In the **Action** column, click the three vertical dots.
5. In the drop-down menu, select **Change**, identified by a paper and pencil icon.
6. In the **Application Configuration** window, locate the **Enable*** filter and click **No**.
