This article presents how to access password information from **MySafe** via API, the available endpoints, the parameters needed, example requests, and responses on success or in case of errors.

## Authorization
The authorization for **MySafe** APIs is performed directly in the module. For more information, access the [How to add an access key authorization](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-how-to-add-an-access-key-authorization) document.

## Authentication

Authentication in the **MySafe APIs** is conducted using the OAuth 2.0 authentication method. To initiate this process, users need to provide the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, as well as obtain their **authentication token** from the endpoint:

```
GET /api/oauth2/token
```

For more information on how to obtain the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret**, access the [How to view an access key authorization](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-how-to-view-an-access-key-authorization) document.
