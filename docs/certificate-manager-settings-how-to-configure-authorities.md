This article explains how to set up the **Certificate Authorities** feature. A Certificate Authority (CA) is an entity tasked with issuing, renewing, revoking, and overseeing digital certificates. These entities can be either public or private. Registering the authorities lends credibility to the certificate managing process by verifying the authenticity of company interactions and data exchanges.

## Create a new authority

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Certificate Manager**.

3. In the top right corner, click **View actions** (the three vertical dots icon).
4. Select **New**; this will open the **Certificate Authority** form.
