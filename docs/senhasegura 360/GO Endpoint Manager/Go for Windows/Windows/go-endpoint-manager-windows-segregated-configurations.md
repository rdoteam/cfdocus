# Segregated parameters 

OverviewYou can use segregated configurations for specific workstation scenarios. This feature is available at:Control of directories and filesScan of directories and filesSegregated parametersaccess listsCommandsFor segregation by users, this feature is available at:Segregated parametersCommandsConfigure segregated settingsThe workstation may belong to a user who requires special attention or differentiated use.To configure a segregated parameter, follow these steps:Access the senhasegura platform.Enter the GO Endpoint Manager ➞ Settings ➞ Segregated parameters.Go to the ⁝ icon, and select New segregation for workstations.On the General tab, set the desired parameters for the workstation.On the Workstations tab, define the workstations to which the rules will be applied.Click Save.Segregation for UsersSegregation allows users of the GO Endpoint Manager module to access their machines when using more than one workstation. In cases where the user needs access to several different workstations, you can create a single policy for the user instead of a policy for each machine. Segregation for the user also applies if a list for the user and the workstation overlapping. The rule will be applied and respect the order of priority first allowlist, denylist, and parameters.InfoUsers using more than one workstation appeared twice in the same report.
