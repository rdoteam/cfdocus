# Session recording 

The GO Endpoint Manager agent for Windows allows certain users to be monitored by video during the entire session.Go Agent Recording RulesThe agent's recording logic for applications executed using the Go Agent is influenced by access list rules as follows:Application Non-Recording List: If an application is on the list marked to prevent recording, it will not be recorded.Absence of a List: The application will not be recorded if there is no list.Permitted Recording List: An application will be recorded only if it is on a permitted recording list and there is no list denying recording for that application.Configure parameters for recordingRecord session for these application: access the Go Endpoint Manager ➔ Policies ➔ Windows ➔ Access List ➔ ⁝  ➔ New general segregation.Enable recording session?: global parameter mentioned in go configuration in GO Endpoint Manager ➔ Settings ➔ Parameters.Monitoring happens only when:The global parameter and the access list are active and related to the recording. Applications that fit into the access list will be recorded, including those outside GO Endpoint Manager.The global parameter is active and without an existing access list.Any execution of GO Endpoint Manager will be recorded.When the user starts a JIT process, all his actions will be audited by video and forwarded to the senhasegura server like a RunAs elevation.InfoSegregated parameters apply in this scenario.Recording reportWhen a user elevates an application, GO Endpoint Manager will record a video while the application is running. As soon as the execution is finished, the video is forwarded to the senhasegura server, making it available for evaluation.CautionThrough the Session Video record action, you can watch the video.
