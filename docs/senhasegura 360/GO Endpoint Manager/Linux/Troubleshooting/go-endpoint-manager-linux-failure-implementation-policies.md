# Failure in the implementation of access policies 

The access policy was deactivated but not removed from the workstation. As a consequence, the updated access policy is not applied to the workstation with the installed Agent.SolutionThe secpack-maestro service is always running and updating the rules as they are registered in senhasegura. However, if there is a need for manual intervention on the workstation, follow these steps:1. Log into the Linux terminal as the root user.2. Stop the service using the command:service secpack-maestro stop 3. Confirm that the service has been stopped:service secpack-maestro status 4. Remove the desired policies: echo 'delete 100 acl write path="/etc/oracle/tnsnames.ora"' | /usr/sbin/caitsith-loadpolicy 5. Validate if the policy has been removed by checking the policy file again:cat /sys/kernel/security/caitsith/policy 6. In the senhasegura platform, deactivate the rule to prevent it from being applied again.7. Restart the secpack-maestro service:service secpack-maestro start 8. Check the synchronization status between the senhasegura platform and the Agent: systemctl status secpack-maestro9. If necessary, view the synchronization logs to identify where possible errors may be occurring:sudo tail -f /var/log/syslogsenhasegura CommunityTo learn more about this topic, refer to the articles created about the GO Endpoint Manager.If you need further assistance, ask the senhasegura Community.
