# How to manage tenants in senhasegura 

To manage the various tenants in your senhasegura instance, you can use the orbit tool, the same one used to manage the senhasegura environment. This tool includes a series of parameters for configuring and managing the tenants.

## Requirements

* Access to the  of the senhasegura instance that will host the tenants.  
* Administrator access to the senhasegura instance.  
* Have enabled the proxy 2.0.   
  * To find out how to enable the new proxy, access the  document.  
  * Note that if proxy 2.0 hasn’t been enabled, you’ll still be able to execute the multi-tenant commands, but you won’t be able to perform a session on the tenant created since it depends on proxy 2.0.  
* The hardware that will receive multi-tenant must have the following minimum requirements:  
  * 8-core CPU.  
  * 16 GB of RAM.  
  * 256 GB of storage.  
* Access to DNS management is required, as multi-tenant needs a properly configured domain.
    * Note that for each tenant created, you must create a  pointing to senhasegura's IP address.
    * Each tenant will need a certificate to be accessible.

### Best practices

* Reboot the system at the end of the update process.  
* Use SSL.


## Information on accessing and creating tenants

* Access to each tenant is managed independently to ensure maximum security and isolation.  
* To gain administrative access to a specific tenant, you must create an administrator user directly in that tenant.  
* The main tenant's administrator user's scope of action is limited to their own environment, thus promoting a clear separation of responsibilities and privileges.  
* The creation of tenants is carried out individually to ensure the accuracy and security of each configuration.  
* This process allows for careful review and customization of each tenant, ensuring that all configurations are aligned with the specific needs of each client or department.  
* The individual tenant creation approach reinforces security best practices, allowing granular control over each environment.
:::(error) (Caution)
If you only have one tenant, the access to the main tenant, , can be done normally, as in single-tenant scenarios; however, if there are other tenants created, the access will be exclusively through . 
:::
* if you access senhasegura via the IP address, the tenant that will be accessed will always be the main tenant, .
* The tenant's name may only contain the following characters: ,  and .
* The tenant name cannot start with a number.
* Reserved words that cannot be used when creating a tenant:
    * .
    * .
    * .
    * .
    * .
    * .
    * .

## Create a tenant

The default tenant, created when you first instantiate senhasegura, will always be named . This name cannot be changed.

:::(info) (Info)  
The  command must always be run with administrator privileges, so it will always be run as root using .
:::

To create a new tenant, type the command `sudo orbit tenant create 
.`

The orbit tenant command accepts flags that modify its default behavior. To find out which flags are accepted, you can type  in the terminal or access  document.

- Note that you can pass more than one flag at the same time by separating them with a space. For example, 

Type  at the terminal prompt to proceed with the creation process. To cancel the process, type  or , or press .

The output of the command to create the tenant will be as in the example below:

`bash
Are you sure you want to create a new tenant: y
Creating tenant storage
Creating tenant database
Executing database migration process
Changing database passwords
Checking tenant key configuration
Restarting Orbini services...
`

Note that by using the  flag, you won't be asked before creation, so the output of the command with the  flag will look like this:

`bash
Create tenant storage
Create tenant database
Executing database migration process
Changing databse passwords
Checking tenant key configuration
Restarting Orbini services ...
`

:::(info) (Info)
The tenant's name will be the subdomain used to access it. For example, if you have created the tenant test, access will be via .
:::

## Delete a tenant
If necessary, you can delete a previously created tenant. To do this, type `sudo orbit tenant delete 
`. This will delete the tenant you created.
* For example:  will delete the previously created tenant with the name .

Type  at the terminal prompt to proceed with the deletion process. To cancel the process, type  or  or press . Note that when you use the  flag, you won't be prompted and the command will run without asking any questions. This operation erases all data from the tenant.

The output of the command will be:

`bash
$ sudo orbit tenant delete paulog
Are you sure you want to delete the tenant paulog? This Action is irreversible.: y
Removing tenant storage
Deleteing tenant database
Restarting Orbini services...
`
    
## Disable a tenant

If necessary, you can disable a previously created tenant. To do this, type `sudo orbit tenant disable 
 name`. This will disable the tenant you created.

- For example:  will disable the previously created tenant with the name .

Type  at the terminal prompt to proceed with the disabling process. To cancel the process, type  or  or press . Note that when you use the  flag, you won't be prompted, and the command will run without asking any questions.

This operation keeps all the tenant's data, making it possible to undo it by re-enabling the tenant using the enable command.

## Enable a tenant

If you have disabled one of your tenants and want to re-enable it, type the command `sudo orbit tenant enable 
`. This will enable the tenant.

- For example:  will enable the previously created tenant with the name .

Type  at the terminal prompt to proceed with the enabling process. To cancel the process, type  or  or press . Note that when you use the  flag, you won't be prompted, and the command will run without asking any questions.

The output of the command to create the tenant will be as in the example below:

`bash
Are you sure you want to proceed: y
Executing database migration process
`

## Synchronize tenants

If necessary, you can proceed to synchronize the tenants. This process aims to synchronize the tenants between the nodes in the cluster.

To synchronize the tenants, type 

Type  at the terminal prompt to proceed with the synchronization process. To cancel the process, type  or  or press . Note that when you use the  flag, you won't be prompted, and the command will run without asking any questions.

## Configure a tenant

If necessary, you can set up a tenant. To do this, type `sudo orbit tenant configure 
`.

- For example: .

Type  at the terminal prompt to proceed with the (re)configure process. To cancel the process, type  or  or press . Note that when you use the  flag, you won't be prompted, and the command will run without asking any questions.

The output of the command to reconfigure a tenant will be as in the example below:

`bash
Are you sure you want to reconfigure this tenant: y
Creating tenant storage
Executing database migration process
Changing database passwords
Checking tenant key configuration
Restarting Orbini services...
`

This command will redo the entire configuration in the same way as creating a tenant, making it useful when configuration problems occur when creating a tenant.

## List tenants

If necessary, you can list the existing tenants in your senhasegura instance. To do this, type the command . The tenants will be listed sequentially, displaying each one's code, name, and current status.

The output of the tenant listing command will be as follows:

`bash
+--------------------------------------+------------------+---------+
|                 CODE                 |      TENANT      | STATUS  |
+--------------------------------------+------------------+---------+
| 018debbb-0902-740c-a07b-6cb18d7rfg5b | senhasegura      | ENABLED |
| 01905595-1ed8-7744-bcb9-afeb87009173 | tenant1          | ENABLED |
| 019055a8-7a9d-769c-8371-8ea3913a4c31 | tenant2          | ENABLED |
+--------------------------------------+------------------+---------+
`

## First access

When you first access the multi-tenant environment, a few steps will be required to access the environment. These are:

1. Accept the EULA (End User License Agreement).  
2. Enter the senhasegura activation key.  
3. The first access must be made with the senhasegura default user.

:::(error) (Atenção!)
In the multi-tenant scenario, the default login user for the tenants created is .
:::

## Important information

### Filesystem

The file system for senhasegura with multi-tenant will follow the pattern

`bash
/var/storage/senhasegura
/var/storage/tenant1
/var/storage/tenant2
`

The name of the folder where the tenant's data will be stored is the same name given to the tenant when it was created.

### Backup

The backup procedures are the same as for the main senhasegura instance. You can find more information in the backup documentation on the Backup link in the Help Center.

However, the backup directories have changed. Because of the multi-tenant environment, the backups will be stored in a sub-folder within each tenant's folder, so each tenant has its own backup folder, as shown in the example below.

`bash
/var/storage/senhasegura/backup
/var/storage/tenant1/backup
/var/storage/tenant2/backup
`

### Orbit Config Manager

The Orbit settings option, accessed through  path, will only be available in the senhasegura default tenant. In the other tenants, this option won't be available. It is also not possible to add permission to view this option.
