# How to tuning the environment 

The tuning of the environment is performed by changing environment properties of the PHP Webserver, database and engine. This way, all service architecture will work in a way more adequate to the hardware resources available in this instance.Tuning settings should always be performed at the end of a new instance deployment, or when there is a hardware resizing that could affect the server's CPU and RAM.This same configuration can be done through the menu Orbit Config Manager > Server > System tuning.InformationIf you are not aware of the variables handled by this command, we recommend that you use tuning via the Orbit web interface. Through the web interface Orbit itself will calculate the best server usage scenario.CautionThis command will restart the PHP Webserver, Database and Engine services. Improper configuration of values may stop the operation.mt4adm@vmdf-giskard:~$ sudo orbit tuning --help

Application tuning configuration

Flags:
  --help                       Show context-sensitive help.

  --db-max-conn=INT            The maximum number of simultaneous client
                               connections
  --db-buffer-pool=INT         DB buffer pool size (MB)
  --db-thread=INT              Number of threads used to apply write sets
                               when in cluster.
  --ws-workers=INT             The number of worker processes
  --ws-workers-children=INT    The maximum number of connections that each
                               worker process can handle simultaneously
  --force                      Force the command execution, never prompt
  --show
By default, senhasegura is installed with a tuning profile for two CPUs and 4G RAM. You can list the applied tuning values with the argument –show.mt4adm@vmdf-giskard:~$ sudo orbit tuning --show
  DB Connections:          750
  DB Buffer Pool Size:     768M
  Number of threads:       8
  Worker processes:        2
  Process connections:     75
You can define all the variables through the other arguments.mt4adm@vmdf-giskard:~$ sudo orbit tuning  
    --db-max-conn=750  
    --db-buffer-pool=768  
    --db-thread=8  
    --ws-workers=2  
    --ws-workers-children=75

The application services will be stopped or restarted during the process.

Likewise, you can change only a few parameters, if necessary. But regardless of which parameter is affected, all services will be restarted.mt4adm@vmdf-giskard:~$ sudo orbit tuning --db-thread=4
