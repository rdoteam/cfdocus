# Reports 

Cloud IAM provides detailed reports on entities registered on the following Cloud Service Providers (CSPs):

AWS.
Azure.
Google Cloud.

The reports reprocess information from the CSPs registered every 1 hour to keep the reports up-to-date. If desired,
    you can manually reprocess information anytime by clicking the Reprocess accounts button in the
    bottom right corner of all reports.
