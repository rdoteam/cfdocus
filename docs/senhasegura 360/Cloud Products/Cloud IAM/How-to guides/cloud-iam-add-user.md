# Add user 

Users are considered to be those with personal console access to the cloud providers' accounts.

Caution

Users and service accounts synchronism won't remove roles and permissions added directly to the Cloud. In
            this case, the permissions will be synced up, bringing the new ones to senhasegura. If the permission was
            inactivated/removed within senhasegura, it will also be removed from the Cloud Service Provider.


Create user
To create a user, go to the menu Cloud IAM ➔ Cloud IAM ➔ Users.


Click on the action button and select Add user;


In the form, select the senhasegura user that will have access to the accounts;



Caution

If you are within an access group that has a template defined, the user list may only be displaying users
            from the department selected in the template.




In the Settings tab, select which provider you want to create the user at and fill in the
            rest of the fields:

User responsible: indicates which user of the senhasegura is responsible for the user
                at the cloud provider.




Caution

This information, also defines which senhasegura user can log into an instance in the Virtual Machines module
            using this Cloud user.



TTL (seconds): defines the lifetime of the user and its credentials. This time is decreasing
        and starts to be valid from its creation and at the end the user will be automatically deleted from the
        provider.
Description: Detailed user description.
Tags: Tags used to make it easier to search filters and to segregate the user in access groups.
