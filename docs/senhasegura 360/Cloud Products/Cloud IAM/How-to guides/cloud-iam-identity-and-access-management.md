# Identity and Access Management 

 refers to policies, technologies, and processes for managing user identities and controlling access to cloud environments and their resources.

IAM systems differ from traditional authentication methods because, in addition to verifying users' identities, they include authorization mechanisms to determine what resources users can access. They also manage user accounts and permissions, provide access control policies, and generate auditing reports. However, managing IAM in multi-cloud environments is challenging because most Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) differ in architecture, terminology, and range of services provided. 

 provides centralized governance for multi-cloud environments by allowing you to manage entities and access across multiple CSPs using one single console.
