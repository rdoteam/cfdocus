# Introduction Executions 

senhasegura features must perform asynchronous tasks into target systems to change passwords, execute privileged tasks, etc. These systems run with standard protocols or interfaces easily managed by senhasegura over its Executors.The senhasegura Execution module will centralize all operations targeting execute commands or interactions over remote systems. Keeping all client modules notified, giving a rich audit trail, logs, retrying over failures, and rich data dashboards to increase the client's secure governance.How to use Execution ModuleCreate or Edit TemplatesChange Credential PasswordCreate a Chained ExecutionTemplatesTemplates are the source code of the task to be executed. It has a particular syntax defined by its Executor and can be composed using tags representing credentials, SSH Keys, Devices, Certificates, DSM Secrets, or User defined values. During the execution, senhasegura will replace these tags with the information.But let's look at the following chart to understand how they interact.A password change running by Execution module example As the image demonstrates, the trigger origin will request an asynchronous execution to the Execution module. Many modules can order this execution.The trigger can be a password view, the use of a credential in session, a password expiration, a manual request by an administrator, and other modules' particular triggers.This request will then create an operation.In this example, the operation is composed of an Executor to perform the interface with the target system, a Template containing the interactions that the executor must perform, and a target Credential that will be affected by the template commands in the target system.At the end of the operation, the result will be recorded in senhasegura. The requesting module will be noticed. From its start to finish, all operation details are recorded in the client module reports and the Execution module. SYSLOG/SIEM messages will be echoed, and dashboards will be updated to ensure corporate governance.Executors pluginsThey are engines used to connect and interact with a target system. The system can be an SSH server, a Windows over RPC, a website, a Webserver, a Cloud Provider, or any other interactive system.OperationsIt represents an execution of a template in a target device. When you request a password change, for example, it will create an operation. The operation can have multiple execution attempts.Chained operation using parent-child credential schemaAs an Administrator, you can create a chained operation using parent and child credential configuration. With this, the Execution module will register and schedule password changes to all child credentials when the parent credential has its password changed successfully.The child's operation result will not affect the parent's result and others child's operations.A chained operation using parent-child schema When the execution can be triggeredThe Execution module can be used to:Automated password change in senhasegura PAM ProxyWhen a credential password period expiresWhen a user views a credential passwordWhen a session uses a credentialWhen some WebService A2A Application requestedWhen its parent credential started a chained change actionCredential activation or inactivation by senhasegura PAM ProxyWhen a user needs to start a session using a locked credentialWhen a user needs to start a session using a JIT credentialWhen a user finished a sessionWhen an automated task needs to start in the Task Manager ModuleWhen a user triggers the task executionWhen the task execution schedule triggered the executionWhen an SSL certificate, managed by Certificate Manager Module, needs some actionWhen a certificate request should be releasedWhen a certificate needs to be signed into a CAWhen a certificate needs to be revokedWhen a certificate needs to be publishedThrough the Execution module, the user will have control over the following actions:Request privileged information changingTrack privileged information operationsDetail attempts to change privileged informationsRequest a privileged information changing reconciliationConfigure privileged information operations automationKnow the privileged information changing parametersCreate new privileged information changing templatesSegregate devices and credentials through profilesConfigure threaded automationsTo accomplish its functions, the Execution module can be divided into three major entities.Related articlesExecutorsOperationsPassword changeThe Execution module can be divided into three major entities to accomplish its functions.
