# Chained operation automation 

Automating password change operations allows users with administrator privileges to perform operations, such as
    password change linked, automatically or manually.

Info

Linked execution is understood as an operation where the password of a target credential must be
                replicated to several different destinations. Sometimes containing different systems that
            require different executors and templates. For example: Ensuring that the database password is replicated
            for services hosted on Linux and Windows servers.
Using the automation script elaboration syntax, you can determine whether the operation will be performed
            when all credentials have been successfully changed or even when only part of them have been successfully
            executed.


In the configuration of an execution script, it is possible to select the operation to be performed and the strength
    of the changed passwords.
The run can also be configured automatically on predetermined days and periods. You can also select a minimum
    interval between linked password change runs.

Caution

To exemplify its use in this document we will use the automation to run password change scripts, however this
            functionality can be used for any script.



SQL Linked Server
Using the senhasegura Operation Automation, you can easily change Microsoft®SQL Server Linked
    Servers passwords replicating accounts using senhasegura out-of-the-box templates for SQL Server instances.
senhasegura offers two different templates to deal with dynamic port configuration or static
        port configuration.

Caution

When the SQL Server works with dynamic port configuration, you should configure the senhasegura device with
            the UDP port where SQL Server will publish which TCP port SQL Server is running in.




The Automated Operation Flow for SQL Linked Server

 


Into the example image you can see that this architecture are composed by two Microsoft®SQL Server instances running
    with Linked Server dynamic ports. So the device registered into senhasegura should have the UDP port configured.
senhasegura then will first query the UDP port for the right TCP port where the SQL Server is accepting database
    connections. So senhasegura will connect to this port to perform the template tasks.
Finished this first instance, and doesn't matter if it was successfully executed or not, senhasegura will then
    connect to the next server and go on.
The main difference between the use of chained operation and parent credentials is the fact that in chained operation
    you can use special syntax to determine which template should be replaced for Linked Server environments.

Register an automation
To register an automation, go to the menu Executions ➔ Operations automation ➔ Automations

Click on the actions button and select the option New
On the Settings tab, complete the following fields:
Automation Name: Name. For internal control only
Operation: type of automation. In this version, only the Chained
                    exchange option will be available
Password strength: Password strength used for automation. We recommend using
                    the weakest device password policy so that you can be sure that all members of the chain receive the
                    same password.
Execution script: Script that makes up the chain of execution between devices
Active?: Indicates whether automation is active for use or not


In the Executiontab, fill in the following fields:
Enable automatic execution?: Indicates whether automatic automation execution is active
                or not. If activated, the senhasegura will perform its execution from time to time
Days to run: Automation will run on selected days of the week
Execution periods: Automation will be performed within the selected periods
Minimum interval between runs: Minimum interval between runs in hours


Click the Save button to complete the settings.


The syntax of an automation script
The script will give the sequence by which each device will be reached. Therefore, it is important that you already
    have this information properly mapped before you start writing the script.
check_conn
Requires validating connectivity of target devices before starting the process. If the target device is not
    accessible, abort the operation. It contains no additional arguments and it is preferable that this command is at
    the beginning of the script.
rollback
Roll back the automation if any changes are not made. The rollback itself will be performed only at the end of the
    entire execution. That is, in an change of 10 credentials, if an error occurs in the fourth credential, it will
    still continue executing the others until the end, and so it will rollback the entire operation.
This guarantees visibility to the administrator of which credentials are having problems.
In case the rollback command is not added, senhasegura will perform the change for all desired credentials but will
    not perform the rollback if an error occurs in one, some or all credentials.
linked_tpl uint: id
Determines which template will be used to change passwords when dealing with a Linked Server.
This causes the change template configured in the credential to be ignored and replaced by the template designated in
    the script.
The parameter id is a positive integer referring to the Id of the desired template.

change string: type uint: id string: is_linked
Changes the Credential or Pool of credentials, determined by the parameters type and id.
If the parameter is_linked is filled with linked, the
    template determined by the command linked_tpl will be used for the change.
The parameter type can vary between cred for when the
    value of id is the Id of a credential, or pool when
    the value of id is the Id of a credential pool.
The id parameter will always be a positive integer.
Look at the example below for better understanding.
## Lines started with sharp are comment

## Force connectivity validation before usage
check_conn

## Sets the linked server template.
## Its will use the template id 87
linked_tpl 87

## Sets the rollback flag
rollback

#### Sets the credential's or pool's change chain

## Change credentials 120 to 122.
## But credential 122 must use linked server template
change cred 120
change cred 121
change cred 122 linked

## Change credential pool 42 and 45
change pool 42
change pool 45


Perform an automation
To perform an automation, go to the menu Executions ➔ Operations Automation ➔ Automation.
Click the Run button. The automation of operations will be scheduled and the user will be able to
    view the result in the menu View executions, described below.

Info
The execution option is disabled for disabled actions.


View runs
To view the automation execution history, go to the menu Executions ➔ Operations Automation ➔
        Executions.
On this screen, you can view various information on automation executions, such as number of operations performed,
    the result of the execution, if processed, ended in error, as well as the requesting user and the execution date of
    the request.
Click on the View operations button to get more details on the result of your operation. Each record
    on this screen corresponds to the execution of each target credential.
When the script is configured to run a Credential Pool, each credential in the pool will be shown
    record by record.
