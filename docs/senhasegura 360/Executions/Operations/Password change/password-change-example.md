# Locate User Entry find "DC=senhasegura,DC=com" (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=[#USERNAME#])) 
# Change Password mod-replace unicodePwd "u([#NEW_PASSWORD#])"ExampleThe CN=Users,DC=senhasegura,DC=com in the bind should be replaced by the DN (distinguished name) where the credential that will execute the change exists.Go to the credential that will be changed in PAM Core ➔ Credentials ➔ All and click EditGo to Execution Settings Tab to enable the automatic change and select the changed plugin to LDAP and Change the template to the one created in the steps aboveDefine if the change will be done through the credential itself or another service user credential in the Authentication settings, now, any time that one of the triggers is activated, this credential's password will be changed.Go to the credential that will be changed in PAM Core ➔ Credentials ➔ All and click EditLinux user password changeRequirementsHave a Linux credential createdThe change password templateGo to Executions ➔ Settings ➔ Templates, then create a new template or copy the Change Password, which will be used in this exampleIn the execution template, select the SSH executor plugin and define the Execution type as Change passwordIn this example, it would be to change the senhaADM password user in the content add:nScript # Clear sudo session expect-regex "/[$|#|>]/" exec "sudo -k"
