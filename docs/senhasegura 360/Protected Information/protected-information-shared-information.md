# Shared Information 

OverviewIn the Settings ➔ Access groups menu, you can access the access groups configured report for personal information. You can even create new access groups.On the Access limitation tab, it is possible to restrict the information access by dates, days of the week, and hours. In case a user that belongs to one of the access groups tries to access the information in date, day, or time out of the restrictions configured, it will get an error message indicating a restriction issue.Unlike credential access groups, personal information access groups do not have a criteria tab. This means that only security policies and member users are configured.The maintainer of the registered information has the power to decide on who that information will be shared for, not the access group administrator.Note that by not having the criterion as an attribute of an access group, the name of the access group should reflect the security policies.Registering a new Access GroupWhen clicking on the option to create a new access group, the Access group registration screen will open and there firstly, it's necessary to fill up the following fields and options:Access group name: name of the access group that matches the rules that this group applies. This makes easier understanding and auditing;Description: a brief description of the access group;Enabled: whether the group is active or not. Disabling a group can reduce the amount of information the user has access to or reduce the level of security required to access the information;After filling up the initial fields and options, all other configuration options are separated by tabs:Settings:protected information settingsUser can view the protected information: flag if the user can see the protected information;It requires justification to view the protected information: flag whether it is necessary to register a justification to see the protected information;It requires approval to view the protected information: flag whether another user will need to act as an approver to see the protected information.

All users with access will only be allowed to view the secret.Shared Information Form  Once the information is registered, the secret holder can view the information and observe which users have access to the secret.
