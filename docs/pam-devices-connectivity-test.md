All devices go through a defined connectivity verification flow. This flow occurs every 3 minutes and determines which devices are connectable.

The senhasegura’s platform allows you to generate a report of all devices and their connectivity status.

## Connectivity Tests

To list the available devices, follow the steps below:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, indicated by the nine squares, and select **Devices**.
2. On the side menu, select **Connectivity Tests**.
3. A screen listing all successfully connected devices will appear.
4. The listing, by default, will only show successfully connected devices. This information appears in the **Connectable** column of the listing. The column **Message** shows the **Successfully Connected** message if the device is available.

## Filter devices

In the Connectivity Tests screen, in the top bar, you have several fields that you can use to filter your devices:

1. In the **Date** field, you’ll select the start date of the filtering.
2. In the **until** field, you’ll select the end date of the filtering.
3. In the **Device** field, you’ll fill in the hostname, name, or IP of the device you want to filter.
4. Select the connection protocol you want to filter from the **Connectivity** drop-down.
5. Select the connection status of the devices you want to filter from the **Connectable** drop-down.
6. From the **Result** drop-down, select the message you want to filter by.
7. After selecting the fields and menus you want to use to filter the devices, click the **Filter** button to display the results of your filtering, and the **Clear** button to remove the selected filtering parameters.
