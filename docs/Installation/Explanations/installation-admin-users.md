# Administrative users 

senhasegura provides two key administrative users for system management:   

*  for SSH access.
*  for web interface administration. 

It’s crucial to prioritize the security of administrative passwords to prevent any unauthorized access or potential risks.

:::(Warning) (Important)
For security reasons, it is recommended to change the administrative username  during first login. See the  documentation for detailed instructions.

::: (warning) (Caution)
Upon your initial login, you’ll be prompted to establish a new password. Make sure to choose a strong password and securely store it. Avoid saving the new password within the senhasegura application.

## Password policy for the mt4adm user
For security reasons, senhasegura requires a change of the mt4adm user's password. This password must also follow a series of security standards when created. The criteria and rules that will be applied are detailed below:

* The user will have a maximum of three attempts to enter the password before an error is returned, preventing repeated attempts at improper access.
* The password must contain at least 12 characters.
* The password must include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one number.
* The password must be created with a special character (, , , ).
* The new password must have at least 10 changes from the previous password to ensure that similar patterns are not used consecutively.
* The password must not be present in common password lists () in several languages, preventing the use of weak or known passwords that could be the target of dictionary attacks.
