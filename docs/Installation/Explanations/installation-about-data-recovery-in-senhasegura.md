# About data recovery in senhasegura 

senhasegura uses  as a high-availability cluster technology to ensure the integrity and continuity of data.

## Incremental State Transfers 
In situations of temporary interruption in replication between cluster members, the default configuration allows for a tolerance of approximately 3 hours. During this period, the cluster automatically performs Incremental State Transfers (IST) for resynchronization, sending only the affected incremental data. 

Itâ€™s important to emphasize that this approach eliminates the need for manual intervention, as the cluster is designed to handle resynchronization automatically during temporary interruptions.

## State Snapshot Transfers 
In cases of more prolonged interruptions, the adopted solution is to conduct a complete data transfer, known as State Snapshot Transfers (SST). This approach ensures that all cluster members are synchronized, preserving data consistency based on resynchronization from a member with reliable data.

Overall, the senhasegura cluster is robust and intelligent enough to resolve resynchronization automatically by autonomously executing a complete data transfer (SST).
