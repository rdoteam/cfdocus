# Supported architectures 

In this article, you’ll find the different types of architecture supported by senhasegura. InfoAll the architectures mentioned below are also compatible with hybrid systems, which include a combination of on-premises data centers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).Supported architecturessenhasegura supports the following architectures:Single Virtual Appliance with no Backup (DR)This architecture deploys a single Virtual Appliance on Site 1 without Disaster Recovery backup.Two Virtual Appliances with a Backup Location (DR)Two Virtual Appliances are deployed on Site 1 with Disaster Recovery backup.Two Virtual Appliances with Remote Contingency (DR)One Virtual Appliance is situated at Site 1, while another is at Site 2, featuring Remote Contingency Disaster Recovery.One PAM Crypto Appliance with no Backup (DR)This scenario involves a single PAM Crypto Appliance on Site 1 and no Disaster Recovery backup.Two PAM Crypto Appliances with HA and no Backup (DR)Two PAM Crypto Appliances are deployed on Site 1 with High Availability (HA) between the appliances. No backup (DR) is included.Three PAM Crypto Appliances with HA and a Backup (DR) without HASite 1 hosts two PAM Crypto Appliances (primary and secondary), with High Availability between them. One PAM Crypto Appliance is situated on Site 2. High Availability is exclusive to inter-site connections, and DR backup doesn’t include HA.Four PAM Crypto Appliances with HA and a Backup (DR) with HATwo PAM Crypto Appliances (primary and secondary) are on Site 1, and two PAM Crypto Appliances are on Site 2. This scenario features High Availability between sites and includes DR backup.Six PAM Crypto Appliances with HA and two Backups (DR) with HA This architecture spans 3 Sites, each with two PAM Crypto Appliances (primary and secondary). It provides High Availability between sites and includes two backups with HA.
