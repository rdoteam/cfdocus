# Syslog 

Syslog messages are based on UDP protocol through port 514 and are a maximum of 1024 bytes in size.
Notification Format
All Syslog messages follow a specific format. An example of a message in Syslog format may be:
2018-06-18T17:49:41-03:00 vm-machine senhasegura 
1426 - Successfully authenticated.

This message can be divided into two parts: Header and Values.
The header is made up of date, time, hostname, and senhasegura ID information, indicating that the message is
    solution specific.
The values present additional event information in the format key = value.


1: PRI


218-06-18T17:49:41-03:00: TIMESTAMP


vm-machine: HOSTNAME


senhasegura_: AAP-NAME
