# About Monitoring 

Because the infrastructure handles critical systems and security, it is important to implement it in the IT
    infrastructure. Tools to facilitate the environment and act quickly in case of failures. In this case, several
    aspects can be monitored by monitoring tools.

Caution

There must be communication between senhasegura and the SIEM, SYSLOG, and SNMP.


Objective
Guide system administrators who use security monitoring functions through the password solution, namely MIB's SNMPv2, SNMPv3, Zabbix and SYSLOG.
The technological system that speeds up the monitoring of items safely and fundamentally both for the planning and
    for the detection of physical resources and correction of methods in a pro-activation way of the items in this way
    operates in the opportunities that can be carried out.
Importance of monitoring

Caution

The configuration of these monitoring will ensure better planning of the strategies to be adopted in several
            critical cases, such as:

Unmounting the backup remote partition
Storage partitions reaching 100% of their capacity
High CPU or memory consumption, which impacts application performance
Such cases must be monitored, as they can lead to the malfunction of the senhasegura application and its
                features.
