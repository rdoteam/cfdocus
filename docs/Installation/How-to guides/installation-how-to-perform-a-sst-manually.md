# How to perform a SST manually 

This article provides instructions on how to perform a full data transfer, known as State Snapshot Transfer (SST), manually on the Primary cluster member.

Only proceed with these steps if you’re certain that no instances of senhasegura are running in your environment.

## How to perform a State Snapshot Transfer manually on the Primary cluster member

### Steps on the Primary member

1. Check the synchronization status:
`Shell
sudo orbit cluster status
`
2. Stop the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo systemctl stop mysql
`
3. Remove old cluster control files:
`Shell
sudo rm /var/lib/mysql/galera.cache


sudo rm /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat


sudo rm /var/lib/mysql/multi-master.info
`
4. Start the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo galera_new_cluster
`
### Steps on the secondary member

::: (warning) (Cuidado)
If you operate a cluster with more than one secondary member, apply the steps intended for the secondary member to all of them.
:::

1. Stop the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo systemctl stop mysql
`
2. Rename the current database data folder to a backup one:
`Shell
sudo mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql-$(date +%d%m%y%H%M)
`
3. Create a new database folder:
`Shell
sudo install -d /var/lib/mysql -o mysql -g mysql
`
4. Confirm that replication is enabled in the configuration file: .

5. Edit the configuration file: .
6. Save the file and exit the editor.
7. Open another terminal and monitor the database logs:
`Shell
sudo tailf /var/log/mysql/mysql-error.log
`
8. Start the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo systemctl start mysql
`
9. Check if the cluster member count is correct in the database log. For example, if there are 2 members, the message should be: .

10. Verify that the synchronization confirmation message is:
`Shell
WSREP: Member 0.0 (vsrv-senhasegura-cert05) synced with group.
