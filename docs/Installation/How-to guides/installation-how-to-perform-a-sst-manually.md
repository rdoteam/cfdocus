# How to perform a SST manually 

This article provides instructions on how to perform a full data transfer, known as State Snapshot Transfer (SST), manually on the Primary cluster member.

## How to perform a State Snapshot Transfer manually on the Primary cluster member

### Steps on the Primary member

1. Check the synchronization status:
`Shell
sudo orbit cluster status
`
2. Stop the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo systemctl stop mysql
`
3. Remove old cluster control files:
`Shell
sudo rm /var/lib/mysql/galera.cache


sudo rm /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat


sudo rm /var/lib/mysql/multi-master.info
`
4. Start the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo galera_new_cluster
`
### Steps on the secondary member

::: (warning) (Cuidado)
If you operate a cluster with more than one secondary member, apply the steps intended for the secondary member to all of them.
:::

1. Stop the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo systemctl stop mysql
`
2. Rename the current database data folder to a backup one:
`Shell
sudo mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql-$(date +%d%m%y%H%M)
`
3. Create a new database folder:
`Shell
sudo install -d /var/lib/mysql -o mysql -g mysql
`
4. Confirm that replication is enabled in the configuration file: .

5. Edit the configuration file: .
6. Save the file and exit the editor.
7. Open another terminal and monitor the database logs:
`Shell
sudo tailf /var/log/mysql/mysql-error.log
`
8. Start the MariaDB process:
`Shell
sudo systemctl start mysql
`
9. Check if the cluster member count is correct in the database log. For example, if there are 2 members, the message should be: .

10. Verify that the synchronization confirmation message is:
`Shell
WSREP: Member 0.0 (vsrv-senhasegura-cert05) synced with group.
