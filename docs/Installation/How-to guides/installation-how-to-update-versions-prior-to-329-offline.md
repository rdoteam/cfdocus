To update senhasegura offline, follow these steps:

1. In another machine with access to the internet, download the update package to a separate device:
`Shell
wget https://repo:HpRh0BVMNVAq@repo.senhasegura.com/bullseye-se-update.sh --no-check-certificate

`
2. Create a folder for the update files inside the  directory.  Use the following command:
`Shell
sudo install -d /var/update -g mt4adm -o mt4adm
`
3. Upload the file downloaded in step 1 to senhasegura's server (via , for example):
`Shell
scp -P 59022 
  mt4adm@
:/var/update
`
4. Add a "" symbol to comment every line in  to prevent it from trying to connect to the internet during the update:
`Shell
sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf

`Shell
sudo orbit shutdown --reboot
`
13. After the reboot is complete, run the following command and type  to confirm:
