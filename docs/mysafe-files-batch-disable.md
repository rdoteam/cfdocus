In addition to individually disabling files, **MySafe** offers batch-disabling, allowing you to disable multiple files all at once. This guide will walk you through it step by step.

## Requirements
One or more active files. To add files, access
[How to add a file](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-files-add).

## Batch-disable files

1. On senhasegura, in the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **MySafe**.
2. In the side menu, select **Files**.
    1. In the checkboxes column, click the checked checkbox to select all files from the list.
    2. Or locate the files you want to disable, and manually check the checkbox of each file.
3. In the bottom right corner of the screen, click **Disable**.
4. In the **Confirmation** pop-up window, you'll view a message similar to the one below:

**“Are you sure you want to disable the 2 records selected?“**

5. Click **Yes** to confirm.
6. The pop-up message **“File disabled successfully”** confirms the action.


You can enable the files again, [individually](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-files-enable) or in a [batch process](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-files-batch-enable).
