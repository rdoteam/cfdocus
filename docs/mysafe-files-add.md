2. In the side menu, select **Files**. 
3. In the upper right corner, click **View actions**, represented by the three vertical dots icon.

6. Still in this window, complete the information:
    1. **Tags**: enter keywords to identify the file.
    2. **Notes**: enter additional observations about the file.
7. Click **Save**.

After completion, you'll receive a confirmation message "File added". In the warning box, you can also share the stored file. 

:::(warning) (**Important**)
The system stores **MySafe** files in a separate directory from other products, so purge routines, like the PAM Core routine for video sessions, do not affect it. However, the additional files use the same disk space, so the administrator must monitor and expand it if required.
:::

When you finish adding, the files will be displayed on the Files homepage on the report.

:::(info) (**Info**)
You can also add a file by accessing the drop-down menu on the MySafe homepage, in the upper right corner, **+Add File**.
