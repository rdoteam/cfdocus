## How to configure and verify credentials associated with Windows services
senhasegura can identify credentials used by running Windows services. This article provides instructions on how to configure and use this functionality.

### Requirements
To ensure the correct functioning of the credential search functionality associated with Windows services, you must meet the following requirements:

* Searching for local accounts associated with Windows services only occurs when device discovery is configured to retrieve credentials.

* At least one local credential must be identified during the scan to enable the service search.

* The target machine must have an active connection via **WinRM** to bring the local accounts associated with the services.

* The target machine must have the **Powershell** installed, and the credential used in the search must have authorization to access the records of the **Win32_Service** and carry out consultations.
:::(Warning) (Caution)

* The functionality is configured to find local accounts associated with the Windows service and cannot locate domain accounts.

* To configure the lookup of credentials used by service, you must use the search option by Device.
