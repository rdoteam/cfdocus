## Metadata_End
This article presents how to terminate any proxy session in **PAM Core** via API, the available endpoints, the parameters needed, example requests, and responses on success or in case of errors.

## Authorization

To get started, make sure **PAM Core** is listed under **Authorized resources** in your **A2A** module. For more information on authorization, access the [How to create an authorization for an application](/v3-32/docs/a2a-how-to-create-an-authorization-for-an-application) documentation.

## Authentication
Each request in the API must have the **OAuth Consumer Key** and the **OAuth Token** of the client. 
For more information on authentication, access the [How to authenticate an application](/v3-32/docs/a2a-how-to-authenticate-an-application) documentation.

## Methods

### Terminate a proxy session

### Request 

To terminate a proxy session, send a request to the following endpoint:


```
DELETE /iso/session/drop/[session_id]
```

:::(Info) (Info)
Use the endpoint above to trigger external systems, such as SIEM, into ending sessions based on the alerts sent by senhasegura.
:::

#### Request parameters

**Path**


| Field | Type | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|```session_id```| String | Yes | Unique hash generated by senhasegura to exclusively identify a specific session. This identifier is internally used by the application for session-related operations, such as access control, activity tracking, and resource management. Each time[ a session is initiated](/v3-32/docs/a2a-create-an-authenticated-url-for-a-web-proxy-session), a new ```session_id``` is generated for that specific session. The ```session_id``` can be obtained in the response to the request to [List all sessions](/v3-32/docs/a2a-list-remote-session-data). | 3fcf1e4a16104e328d6794e1b9693cfc457871d2 |
