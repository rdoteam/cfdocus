2. On the side menu, select **Settings** >  **Access** > **Triggers transfer**
3. At the **Enable** field, select **No** and click **Filter**.
4. On the list, locate the **Transfer audit** item.
5. In the **Action** column, click on the icon represented by the **check** sign, to activate the trigger.
    1. Click **Yes** on the confirmation box.
6. Still on the platform, in the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Settings**.
7. On the side menu, select **System parameters** > **System parameters**.
8. At the **Remote session** tab, in the **General** section:
    1. Locate the **Enable trigger for file transfer?*** field: check **Yes**. 
9. In the bottom left corner, click **Save**.

When finalized, you can transfer files from your local machine to a remote session or between sessions and have this transfer log on the Transferred files report.


:::(warning) (**Caution**)
When file transfer logs are active, SFTP transfers won't work due to technological constraints.
