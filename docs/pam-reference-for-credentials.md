### Credential password change settings

| Field | Description |

| Enable agent-based password change | This feature that allows users to change their passwords through an automated process facilitated by a software agent is called agent-based password change. |
| Change plugin | Select the plugin used to connect and execute the change on the device. This plugin is linked to several connection protocols, there is no validation that the device has its connectivity active. |
| Change template | Select the template that the executing plugin will execute. In the senhasegura PAM solution, the user has access to a wide variety of templates developed and regularly updated. |

### Authentication Setup

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Use own credential to connect | Select to use the credential itself to connect to the device and perform the password change. |
| Authentication credential | If you don't use your own credential to change the automated password, select which credential will be used to connect to the device. |

It's possible to use a credential to start sessions on the device, and another already registered to perform the password change.

### Reconciliation Credential Setup

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Enables credential reconciliation. Check **Active** or **Inactive** to define the status of the credential. |
