In addition to individually disabling API secrets, **MySafe** offers batch-disabling, which allows you to disable multiple API secrets all at once. This guide will walk you through it step by step.

## Requirements

* One or more enabled API secrets. To add API secrets, access [How to add an API secret](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-api-secret-add).

## Batch-disable API secrets
1. On senhasegura, in the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **MySafe**.
2. In the side menu, select **API secrets**.
    1. In the checkboxes column, click the checked checkbox to select all API secrets from the list.
    2. Or locate the API secrets you want to disable, and individally click the checkbox of each API secret.
3. In the bottom right corner of the screen, click **Disable**.
4. In the **Confirmation** pop-up window, you'll view a message similar to the one below:

**“Are you sure you want to disable the 2 records selected?“**

5. Click **Yes** to confirm.
6. The pop-up message **“API secret disabled successfully”** confirms the action.

:::(Info) (Info)
To view the API secrets, go to **MySafe > API secrets**. Locate the **Enable** search filter. Click **Yes** to view a list with only the active API secrets; click **No** to view only the disabled API secrets, and clear the field to view all the API secrets.

If needed, you can enable the API secrets again, [individually](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-api-secret-enable) or in [a batch process](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-how-to-batch-enable-api-secrets).
