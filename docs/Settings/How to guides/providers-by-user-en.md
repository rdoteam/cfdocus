# How to manage user authentication providers

Defining a provider per user is a security measure designed for specific scenarios. For example, it's applicable when dealing with high-trust users who must set up a fallback mechanism for authentication. The system should allow these users to use an alternative option whenever primary authentication fails.

Another situation that requires this measure is the definition of a provider other than the default for a specific user. For more information, access the document on How to manage authentication providers.

:::(error)(Alert!)
Note that if the user has a user authentication provider previously registered, senhasegura will ignore the system's provider and make the attempt using only the user's authentication provider.
:::

:::tip Info
The admin user installed by default in senhasegura has the Local provider as the primary authentication provider.
