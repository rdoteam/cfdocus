# How to batch import users 

Batch Import allows you to quickly create a set of users by uploading a properly filled spreadsheet. This feature is useful for automating the management of large user bases.

Some important points about batch import:

* The import is based on a spreadsheet, according to the import file.  
* Imported spreadsheets are recorded in the system and can be recovered if necessary.  
* Users that do not exist will be created during the import.  
* Users who are already registered in senhasegura and are reimported will be updated.  
* The quickest way to undo an incorrect import is to correct the spreadsheet and import it again.  
* It is recommended not to import a file with more than a thousand items, as this action can consume many server resources and reduce its performance.
