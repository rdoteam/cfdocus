# Logs and data purge 

senhasegura log rotates, and senhasegura data purge has, by default, some particular database tables that turn by
    period. senhasegura Support Team uses many of these tables for diagnostic and troubleshooting steps, which does not
    affect the client's operation. The only table interacting with client operation is the Email sent and Email received
    records. The client's SMTP and POP3 provider can index all of those data. See below the rotated entities and their
    period.

Log date purge
By default, system logs are kept in senhasegura, without a purge period. For backup, the
        retention of logs and secrets will follow the rules of the policy applied at each backup location used.

For example, the information for an external backup may have a retention of more than 2 years.




Asynchronous tasks requests
All operational and log tables used by Orbini Asynchronous Tasks are rotated. The module
    which requested the operation will keep all operation records. These purged data does not have any client operation
    detail or sensitive data.

Orbini Assync PIDs: Records are rotated on the 7th day. It contains the execution
        timestamp and its internal PID used;
Orbini Assync Logger: Records are rotated on the 15th day. It contains the process
        info and error messages;
Orbini Assync Tasks: Records are rotated on the 30th day. It contains execution
        requests provided by the client's modules;
Orbini User Notification: Records are rotated on the 30th day. It contains system
        messages sent to users;
Device Connectivity Tests: Records are rotated on the 30th day. It contains registered
        devices connection test based on registered connections protocol;
LDAP Sync Logs: Records are rotated on the 30th day. Orbini LDAP Synchronizer uses it
        for diagnosing and troubleshooting;
Orbini WebService A2A Requests: Records are rotated on the 30th day. It contains all
        client's requests to WebService A2A ;
Orbini Events: Records are rotated on the 30th day. It contains the data interaction
        timestamp log of the user. Please, do not confuse this table with data events from each module. This table is
        used only for framework purposes;
Orbini Changed Data: Records are rotated on the 30th day. It contains the data
        interaction timestamp log of the user. Please, do not confuse this table with data auditing from each module.
        This table is used only for framework purposes;
Orbini SMTP Emails: Records are rotated on the 180th day. It contains all emails sent
        by senhasegura. These emails can have sensitive information or module-specific information. The client's SMTP
        server can retrieve the same data;
Orbini POP3 Emails: Records are rotated on the 180th day. It contains all emails
        received by the senhasegura configured account. These emails can have sensitive information or module-specific
        information. The client's SMTP server can retrieve the same data;
Orbini User Actions: Records are rotated on the 300th day. It contains All user data
        interaction and login/logout logs;

Session dump data purge
All proxy sessions are recorded in their raw protocol format and stored inside senhasegura data storage. This data
    can also be copied to the client backup repository during the backup procedure.
These data will consume something next to the network traffic during a proxy session. There is no magic number to
    determine the size of a session raw replay file.
At that time, the client will decide if the session should be kept or can be purged by the senhasegura automatic
    purge process.
By default, senhasegura is configured with 90 days of session storage. So if a session occurred more than 90 days
    ago, it would be automatically purged.
This report contains a list of session files stored in senhasegura:
In Settings → Services → Storage files, we can view
    information about the Storage files:

ID: is the file identifier.
Name: is the generated name for the file.
Type: is the type of file extension.
Account: this account is not editable by the standard user, and the account report does not
        allow the creation of new accounts.
Upload: date and time it took place.
Purged: whether it was purged or not.
Status: whether this data is active in the system or not.
Path: the path that this file is on the system.

Prevent session purge
At the Remote session's report, accessed by PAM Core ➔ Credentials ➔ Access control ➔ Remote
        sessions menu, the administrator can prevent the session purge by clicking on Prevent
            purge action on the desired session record;

Change purge interval
At the Settings ➔ System parameters ➔ System parameters menu, go to the Remote
            session section and change the Days for purge field. You can change
    this field defining a new purge period from 1 day to 1000 days;

Disable purge service
The administrator can also inactivate all purge services at Settings ➔ Execution process menu, and
    disable Data archiver and Warehouse purge services;
