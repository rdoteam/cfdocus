Some scenarios for Troubleshooting 

Error: senhasegura does not import all users from Active Directory.
Solution: some users may not be imported after configuring and integrating Active Directory with
    senhasegura. This error is a result of the wrong configuration of the bind.

Error: CPU usage at 100% in senhasegura.
Solution: one of the leading causes of senhasegura consuming 100% of CPU is sessions stuck in the
    environment. Run the command ps aux | grep guacd through the mt4adm credential and
    check the consumption of the displayed sessions.
