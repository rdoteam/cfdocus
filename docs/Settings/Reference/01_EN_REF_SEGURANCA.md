:::tip Info  
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where a malicious website induces an authenticated user on another site, such as a bank, to perform an unwanted action, like a financial transfer. Without CSRF protection, a malicious link can perform this action as if it were the user themselves, using valid session cookies. To prevent this, CSRF tokens are used.
