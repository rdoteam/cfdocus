This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to add a password using the **MySafe** extension.

## Requirements

* The **MySafe** extension installed and activated in your browser. To learn how to install and activate the **MySafe** extension, access the [How to enable the MySafe extension](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-extension-enable) documentation.
:::(Error) (Important)
The automatic detection of username and password fields by the **MySafe** extension may not be compatible with all websites, as we rely on the detection standards for these fields.

We cannot guarantee its functionality in all situations due to the security mechanisms of third-party applications. However, we are continually improving the extension to expand support for a greater number of websites.

## Settings

In the menu located at the bottom of the extension, click **Settings**, identified by two gears, and toggle on the **Enable automatic password save suggestion** function.

## Add a password


1. Access the website where you want to add a password.
2. Fill in your login details (username and password) and log in to the website.
3. After logging in, you will see a pop-up message at the top of the screen asking:  **Add a new password to MySafe?**. Select **Yes** to add the password to the extension's vault.
