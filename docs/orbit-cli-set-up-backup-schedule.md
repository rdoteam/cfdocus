:::

**Commands:**
  - `backup create`: Create a new backup
  - `backup recover`: Recover system to a backup point
  - `backup time`: Configure the system backup daily time

## Execute, restore, and configure backup schedule

### Execute a backup

Senhasegura will backup two databases managed by [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/):
- **mt4**: Database with platform information.
- **senhasegura**: Database with senhasegura platform information.

Execute the `orbit backup create` command to perform a backup on both databases.

:::(Info) (Info)
Some information has been suppressed from this log. But you will see where the backup is executed and where it is copied to at the end of the process.

### Restore a backup

:::(Warning) (Caution)
This procedure restores the database completely, including data and structure, for the desired period of time. Make sure to restore all other application binaries, in case a system update has occurred between the current period and the desired period in the past. The application binary can be restored using the Debian APT tool.
:::

To restore the backup, you must have the original backup files available and ensure that the information to be restored is from a nearby moment to not impact the scope of the devices and ensure the integrity of privileged information.

You should first restore the **mt4 base** and subsequently the **senhasegura base**.
```

orbit backup time
Configure the system backup daily time
Flags:
-h, --help Show context-sensitive help.
--hour=STRING Backup daily time: 0 to 24
  --show           Show the backup daily time
  --force          Force the command execution, never prompt
```

### Configure backup schedule

This command provides the ability to set the time for the backup execution. The process is automated to run every hour, managed by the Linux operating system task scheduler, known as "cron". If a specific time is set, the backup will be triggered automatically at that time.

:::(Info) (Info)
If no time is set, the backup will be scheduled to occur at 5 a.m.
:::

To use this command, simply execute `orbit backup time` and specify the desired time with the `--hour` option, following the 24-hour format (0-24).
To view the currently configured time for the backup, use the `--show` option.
If you wish to execute the command without the need for additional confirmation, use the `--force` option.

```
orbit backup time --hour=STRING
Configure the system backup daily time
Flags:
  -h, --help           Show context-sensitive help.
      --hour=STRING    Backup daily time: 0 to 24
