A request is the process of seeking the issuance of a digital certificate from a Certification Authority. Requisitions are necessary for senhasegura to understand the type of certificate you want and which authority should endorse it. Every requisition includes a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), which shares vital information with the Certification Authority to generate the certificate.

You can create new requisitions from the product or import existing ones. This article explains how to do both actions.

## Create a request

To manually create a request, follow these steps:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Certificate Manager**.

3. In the top right corner, click **View actions** (the three vertical dots icon).
4. Select **New**; this will open the **Requisition** form.
5. In the **General** tab, enter the information:
    1. From the **Certificate type** drop-down, select the desired certificate type.
    2. For **Domain type**, check the desired option.
    3. From the **Organization** drop-down, select an organization and click **Add**.
    4. In **Common name**, type the appropriate name.
    5. In **Expiration (in days)**, set the period for the certificate to remain valid.

    8. From the **Encryption key size** drop-down, select the key size consistent with the algorithm.
    9. From the **Certificate signing algorithm** drop-down, select the algorithm used to sign the certificate through the Certification Authority.
    :::(Warning) (Caution)
    For added security, consider adding a **Store password** for certificate viewing.
