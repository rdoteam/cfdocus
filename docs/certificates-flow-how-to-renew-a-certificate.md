## Renew a certificate
To renew a certificate, follow these steps:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Certificate Manager**.
2. On the side menu, select **Certificates** and then **Certificates**.
3. Locate the certificate you want to renew.
4. In the corresponding **Action** column, click on the three vertical dots icon.
5. Select **Renew certificate**.
    5.1 If you select **Generate the request and sign** and then click **Save**, the application will save the renewal request and open the **[signature form](/v3-32/docs/certificates-flow-how-to-sign-request)**. 
    5.2 If you select **Just generate the request** and click **Save**, the status will remain 'Renewal requested'. The status will only change to 'Valid' after signing.
