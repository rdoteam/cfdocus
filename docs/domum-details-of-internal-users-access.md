:::(info) (Info)
There are differences between **Access reason** and **Justification**. The reasons are traceable; their pre-registration is a mandatory step for granting access. After this step, they’re available in a drop-down menu in the request window and the **Access reasons** menu. The justification is a text written by the administrator at the bottom of the request window.
