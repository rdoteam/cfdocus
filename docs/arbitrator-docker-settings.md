## Set up Docker containers

1. Log in Docker host via SSH
2. Go to the **opt** directory
```SHELL
cd /opt/
```

3. Unzip the **manifests** file
```SHELL
tar -xzvf /tmp/manifests.tar.gz
```

4. Go to the **manifests** directory
```SHELL
cd manifests/
```
:::(info) (Info)
Check the README file to know more about files and instructions.
:::

Now, you have two deploy options: docker-compose and docker with startup script. We **strongly** recommend the use of docker-compose.

---
## Set up Docker variables

Set the kernel parameter needed by the Elasticsearch container

1. Setting up Docker variables
```SHELL
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
echo 'vm.max_map_count=262144' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```
---
## Start Docker containers

### Docker host with internet access

:::(warning) (Caution)
Docker host needs to have access to `registry.senhasegura.io`.
:::

#### Using docker-compose (recommended)

You need to have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed in your Docker host.

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains everything necessary to run both the Galera cluster and Elasticsearch containers.

1. Go to docker-compose directory
```SHELL
cd /opt/manifests/docker-compose
```
2. Start the containers
```SHELL
docker-compose up -d
```
:::(info) (Info)
You can manage both containers at the same time with the commands `docker-compose stop`, `docker-compose start` and `docker-compose restart`.

You can also see both containers logs simultaneously with the command `docker-compose logs -f`.
:::

---

#### Using the script

The `startup.sh` script contains everything necessary to run both Galera cluster and Elasticsearch containers.

1. Go to docker directory
```SHELL
cd /opt/manifests/docker
```
2. Run the startup script
```SHELL
./startup.sh
```
:::info (Info)
You can see the containers logs individually with the commands `docker logs -f garbd-senhasegura-arbiter` and `docker logs -f elasticsearch-senhasegura-arbiter`.
:::

---

### Docker host without internet access

**Use this option if the Docker host doesn't have internet access.**

1. Go to the opt directory
```SHELL
cd /opt/
```

2. Unzip the docker-images file
```SHELL
tar -xzvf docker-images.tar.gz
```

3. Load both images into docker by running the following command:
```SHELL
bash /opt/docker-images/docker-load-images.sh
```

4. Check if the images were successfully imported with the command. Issue the command:
```SHELL
docker images
```

:::(Info) (Info)
They should appear at the very top of the list.
:::

5. Go to docker-compose directory
```SHELL
cd /opt/manifests/docker-compose
```

6. Start up the containers
```SHELL
docker-compose up -d
```
---
## Validate the installation

To verify if everything is working properly, execute the following command on both senhasegura instances:
```SHELL
orbit cluster arbiter status
```

Expected result:
```SHELL
senhasegura cluster arbiter

Status: ENABLED
Arbiter IP address: 192.168.0.5

Galera Cluster arbiter (garbd) status: Connected, OK
Elasticsearch arbiter status: Connected, OK
