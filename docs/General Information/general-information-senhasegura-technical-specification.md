# Technical specification 

senhasegura is a security platform composed of software, operating system, and hardware. This modularized platform meets the most stringent security standards in the industry.In this document, we will cover the main technical aspects of senhasegura.System modules architectureThe senhasegura software solution is divided into the following modules:Modules architecture These components support the operation of the senhasegura from the physical layer to the application layer.Business layer: where all senhasegura features are located, from integrations to activity recording.Application Server layer: where Orbini is located, MT4 developed a framework to support all solution features.Virtual Appliance: a virtual device where the solution is executed.Appliance layer: senhasegura hardware solution.Basic systems solution componentsIn addition to the modules presented, the solution has essential embedded software components integrated into the solution itself without the need for external resources:Optimized and hardened over all aspects (Application, Data Base, File System, etc) Linux-based operating system. The system has only the minimum services running, obeying the Minimum Privilege Principle, and a kernel adapted to the solution's functionality.Own database; no license required.Own and integrated web server.Embedded web interface, no licenses or additional features to use. With just a single network configuration interface, it is already possible for the deployer to have access to the HTTPS web interface so that all other configurations can be performed in a secure and user-friendly graphical environment.PortsOn virtual and physical appliances in senhasegura, only service ports are released:Protocol/PortFunctionTCP/22SSH ServerTCP/80Web Server with redirection to port 443TCP/443Web Application ServerUDP/161SNMPUDP/162SNMPTCP/3389RDP ProxyTCP/3306Database clusterTCP/4444Database clusterTCP/4567Database clusterTCP/4568Database clusterUDP/4567Database clusterTCP/51445senhasegura Network ConnectorTCP/5432DB Proxy PostgreSQLTCP/1433DB Proxy MS SQLTCP/2484DB Proxy Oracle TCPUDP/2484DB Proxy Oracle UDPLanguageInfoBeta language users may encounter misspellings, typos, and words in another language like English.

Updating these components is done through a fast communication channel, and it is performed on customers if a critical demand is released.The tool update process is aligned with the client's update policy. In this case, a team will be deployed to fulfill the installation flow with the least risk of impact on the customer's business.Functional features by modulesCautionThe senhasegura does not allow the installation of other software.Base Module - System access settingsThis module has the following functions:senhasegura Authentication: senhasegura has its authentication module with functionality that implies user blocking after a determined amount of unsuccessful login attempts. Change the password in the first login, validation of the complexity of the new password created with a comparison of the history of passwords used.User Registration: complete user registration with change and configuration traceability.Profile Management: advanced granular profile management with the ability to create according to each user profile.Screen's Log: system screen view log.Screen Identification by codes: each system screen is uniquely identified with a code, making service and support accessible.External Authentication Servers: in addition to its authentication module, senhasegura can be used in conjunction with other directory services. You can set up senhasegura to perform authentication across multiple servers, including establishing an authentication order. The central authentication servers that integrate with senhasegura are Active Directory, LDAP, TACACS, TACACS+, and RADIUS.Two-Factor Authentication: you can reinforce the authentication process through Multi-factor authentication using, for example, the Google Authenticator application.IP Access Blocking: senhasegura can block access through a pre-established IP denylist.Session Management: in the tool, the session management module is responsible for checking session validity and setting a timeout until the next login.Authentication with A1 and A3 Certificates: the authentication process can be carried out using A1 and A3 certificates as the second authentication factor.Single Active Session: Users cannot be logged in to the same senhasegura account from two different sessions simultaneously. If authentication is performed using the Admin account while someone else is already logged in with the same Admin account, the person with the old session will be logged out.Base Module - Password and information vaultThis module is the core of the password vault and has the following functions:Password Guard: storing passwords in the vault, encrypted in AES 256 algorithm with double encryption factor. Passwords can only be accessed in this module through the Access Management module.Protected Information Guard: the password vault allows encrypted storage of information such as tokens, certificates, and files in general.Backup of Secrets: passwords, protected information, and SSH keys require an independent backup unit in the solution.   The information vault and passwords are responsible for writing the secrets to a backup encrypted by the Shamir algorithm-based master vault key.HSM Integration: Integration with external or internal Hardware Security Module devicesBase Module - Equipment registerThis module is the password senhasegura interface with the assets that will have their passwords managed and includes the following functions:Registration Interface: where the equipment registration occurs, either by web screen individually or by the batch registration process.Connector Management: each device has ports for connection and protocol for access. This module manages the configured connections and communicates with the devices.Connectivity Test: periodically, senhasegura will connect to registered devices and validate their connectivity. Users can be alerted of test results.Equipment Profile: equipment types and models have default swap profiles and password templates in the tool. This module relates devices to these policies.Base Module - Access to information, passwords, and session policiesThe access policy module is the only one with access to the password and information vault and has the following functions:Access Workflow: the access workflow initiates an approval process for the delivery of the authenticated session or password. This process has different configurations and routes depending on the client configurations.Access Approvation: the access approval function allows the approving user to respond to the access request by:User screenE-mailSMSEmergency AccessPassword Split: this function breaks the password into two parts. For segmented delivery, and is relevant for PCI compliance.Access Control: the access control module unifies the three entities considered in the decision to surrender the credential or access:Delivery PolicyInvolved UsersRelated EquipmentThe joining of these entities defines the session delivery criteria in the system.User Timing: the access control module can be synchronized with an authentication server. Users of a particular group on the authentication server are loaded into the senhasegura access groups, making access management easier.Base Module - ReportsReporting Configuration:  the user can remove or add information to a particular report through the interface. You can create a whole new view of helpful information for your needs.Shipping Schedule: the reports you create can be set to send to certain users automatically.PCI Reports: a set of specific reports to meet requirements required by PCI audits.Audit Trails: senhasegura contains reports with all relevant system events. Events can be exported to SIEM and Syslog.Base Module - DashboardsSystem Health: responsible for graphically displaying the overview of senhasegura hardware and Virtual Machines. You can view data such as I / O, memory, and processing.Process Monitoring: monitors the execution of crucial vault processes:Password ChangesAccess Group SynchronismsPassword ReconciliationConnectivity TestsSettings BackupPassword's backupBusiness Monitoring: monitors health for credential and information protection:Number of Passwords changed x FailuresBy periodNumber of Sessions:Active and Concurrent x System AverageRecorded (by period)Average session time logged inUsers logged in to the systemPassword Change ModuleSSH Password Change: make the connection and run the default password exchange script on the device using the SSH protocol without the need for agents installed.Windows Server: windows Password Exchange connects to a Windows server and runs local password exchange scripts without needing agents installed.Using native Microsoft protocols (RPC, RM / WMI), senhasegura can interact with the device using commands from the protocols or through PowerShell commands if protocol support is enabled.Network Asset: make the connection and run the default password exchange script on the device using the SSH protocol without the need for agents installed.Desktop: make the connection and execute the default exchange script for that password on that desktop using various desktop-based protocols.Database: make the connection and execute the default exchange script for that password in that database using the base protocol.Password Reconciliation ModulePassword reconciliations happen the same way on servers, network assets, desktops, and banks: accessing devices and accounts is periodically performed, trying to authenticate with the last password in custody, validating whether custody remains under the password safe.Proxy Session ManagementConstant Changes in User's Originating IP Addresssenhasegura does not handle constant changes in a user's originating IP address due to auditing and security reasons. If you're using a VPN that changes your IP often, it may cause frequent disconnections and require you to log back in. For a better experience, we recommend enabling session persistence in your VPN/network settings when accessing senhasegura. This will keep your IP stable, avoiding unnecessary disconnections.Management Module - Windows sessionsSession Delivery: authenticated session delivery is performed without entering a username or password.Session Recording: during access to the authenticated session, the system records the session in video and text.MP4 Video Generation: recorded video can be generated in mp4 format to be downloaded and uploaded.Audited Proxy Support: native audited proxy support for SSH and RDP connectivity of client applications.

This approach eliminates the need for conventional passwords, simplifying the authentication process. Additionally, it significantly strengthens platform security by reducing vulnerabilities associated with traditional password practices.Embedded browser versionToolVersionFirefox91.6.1esr (64-bit)Encryption and security featuresEncryptionSenhasegura uses open-source libraries and software to perform all necessary cryptographic processes for the solution to function securely. All communication between solution components is encrypted using the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol to ensure the security of transmitted messages. In addition, the AES-256 algorithm is used to encrypt information in the database, such as:API keysCredentialsCertificatesAccess tokensTo provide authentication for the senhasegura web interface, both locally and through external authentication servers, user passwords are stored using the SHA-256 hash format. Communication between the client workstation and senhasegura is encrypted and follows the standards of the protocols used, whether RDP, SSH, or HTTPS. Similarly, access to remote target devices is encrypted using the same standard across all protocols that allow configuration.For data in transit security, the OpenSSL library maintained by OpenSSL Software Foundation is used. This is an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. The library, written in the C programming language, implements the main encryption algorithms. In addition, the OpenSSL library is FIPS 140-2 certified. For more information, visit the OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Security Policy.For the security of critical data stored in the database, open-source software GnuPG is used, which is part of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project. This software has the option to work in "fips mode," which ensures that cryptographic processes are performed according to all requirements imposed by the FIPS 140-2 standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).senhasegura complies with security standards such as:FIPS 140-2 - Level 1FIPS 140-2 - Level 2 with an HSM or PAM Crypto ApplianceHSM encryptionFor companies that need a higher level of security, you can opt for the Hardware Secure Module (HSM), a hardware security and encryption device with military specifications and tamper-evident standards.HSM technical specificationsEncryptionRSA (PKCS #1 V2.1) (1024, 2048, 4096 bits)ECDSA (NIST FIPS PUB 186-3)FIPS 197 AES 128, 192, 256FIPS 46-3 DES/3DESSupports certificates x509v3Supports import and internal key generationRandom Number GeneratorInternal, hardware basedMeets AIS31 P2 standardReal time clock (RTC)Internal, maximum deviation of 1 minute per yearAppliance and Appliance Security FeaturesHSM Entrust nShieldHSM KryptusHSM ThalesHSM GEMALTOHSM DINAMOHSM YUBICOWeb proxy cryptographicKey Exchange methods:ecdh-sha2-nistp256ecdh-sha2-nistp384ecdh-sha2-nistp521ssh-curve25519-sha256ssh-curve25519-sha256-libsshdiffie-helman-group-exchange-sha256diffie-helman-group-exchange-sha1diffie-helman-group14-sha1diffie-helman-group1-sha1Supported keys:ecdsa-ssh-nistp256ecdsa-ssh-nistp384ecdsa-ssh-nistp521ssh-ed25519ssh-rsassh-dssMAC methods:hmac-sha2-256hmac-sha2-512hmac-sha1hmac-sha1-96hmac-md5hmac-md5-96hmac-ripemd160hmac-ripemd160-openssh-comCiphers:aes128-ctraes192-ctraes256-ctraes256-cbcrijndael-cbc-lysator-liu-seaes192-cbcaes128-cbcblowfish-cbcarcfour128arcfourcast128-cbc3des-cbcTerminal proxy cryptographicKey Exchange Methods:ecdh-sha2-nistp256ecdh-sha2-nistp384ecdh-sha2-nistp521diffie-hellman-group16-sha512diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256diffie-hellman-group14-sha256diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1diffie-hellman-group14-sha1diffie-hellman-group1-sha1Supported keys:ssh-ed25519ecdsa-sha2-nistp256ecdsa-sha2-nistp384ecdsa-sha2-nistp521ssh-rsassh-dssMAC methods:hmac-sha2-256hmac-sha2-512hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.comhmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.comhmac-sha1hmac-md5hmac-sha1-96hmac-md5-96Ciphers:aes128-ctraes192-ctraes256-ctraes128-cbcaes192-cbcaes256-cbcblowfish-cbc3des-cbcEncryption for SSH sessionsSymmetric ciphers3DESAES128-cbcAES192-cbcAES256-cbcrijndael-cbcAES128-ctrAES192-ctrAES256-ctrAES128-gmcAES256-gmcchacha20-poly1305Symmetric ciphers that support authenticated encryptionAES128-gmcAES256-gmcchacha20-poly1305MAChmac-sha1hmac-sha1-96hmac-sha1-256hmac-sha1-512hmac-md5hmac-md5-96umac-64umac-128hmac-sha1-96-etmhmac-sha1-256-etmhmac-sha1-512-etmhmac-md5-etmhma-md5-96-etmumac-64-etmumac-128-etmKey exchange algorithmsdiffie-hellman-group1-sha1diffie-hellman-group14-sha1diffie-hellman-group14-sha256diffie-hellman-group16-sha512diffie-hellman-group18-sha512diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256ecdh-sha2-nistp256ecdh-sha2-nistp384ecdh-sha2-nistp521curve25519-sha256Certificate keyssh-ed25519-cert-v01ssh-rsa-cert-v01ssh-dss-cert-v01ecdsa-sha2-nestp256-cert-v01ecdsa-sha2-nestp384-cert-v01ecdsa-sha2-nestp521-cert-v01Key typesssh-ed25519ssh-ed25519-cert-v01ssh-rsassh-dssecdsa-sha2-nestp256ecdsa-sha2-nestp384ecdsa-sha2-nestp521ssh-rsa-cert-v01ssh-dss-cert-v01ecdsa-sha2-nestp256-cert-v01ecdsa-sha2-nestp384-cert-v01ecdsa-sha2-nestp521-cert-v01Availability and contingencyThe senhasegura system supports operation on virtual or physical appliances. The senhasegura virtual appliance is customized for installation without releasing administrative users in the operating system.In any configuration, the system supports high availability and external contingency disaster configurations.High AvailabilityContingency and Disaster RecoveryBackupsenhasegura has several mechanisms to recover information in case of failure:Encrypted password backupExternal in client infrastructure. The backup file of this information is password protected, which is distributed in multiple custody among trusted participants at the client's free choice. At least two custodian users are required to receive and retrieve the information. Once the senhasegura delivery ceremony has taken place, all passwords to the safe will be reset and the client will receive their respective custody, except for the passwords to the senhasegura database and operating system.From version 3.10 on the backup procedure will also be performed for user passwords and Access Keys of the DevOps module.Backup fast recoveryInternal and rapid recovery. Stores more critical information, is considered faster, because with the content of the base available the environment is recovered quickly and already becomes accessible upon request.Encrypted backup of settingsAllows not only the stored data but also the password settings to be available for retrieval. This backup is not enabled by default, but its activation is available in system settings.Safe video backupThe senhasegura allows the backup of the videos to be stored in a remote directory under the responsibility of the client. By default the videos are stored in the solution's file system.Secrets backupThe backup of secrets: console credentials and access keys are stored in dedicated directories.Monitoring and Syslog and SIEMsenhasegura has monitoring capabilities designed to alert administrators of any process, integration, connectivity, or access failure.This system issues on-screen alerts to the administrator or via email, SMS, snmpmibs and snmptraps.The solution can be integrated with any industry tool using SNMP V1, V2 or V3 standard.Integration with Syslog and SIEM services.Own integration with ArcSight.Browser compatibilityThe senhasegura web interface is accessible only through HTTPS protocol, and it is recommended that you provide your own SSL certificate in accordance with current security assumptions.senhasegura uses HTML5 and WebSocket technology and only browsers that support these technologies will provide a complete passwords security experience. It also maintains compatibility with browsers in their most recent versions:Internet ExplorerGoogle ChromeMicrosoft EdgeMozilla FirefoxNetwork operating conditionsConnections between users and the senhasegura application have a minimum bandwidth of 180 Kbps per remote session without loss of functionality.Connections between users and the senhasegura application have a maximum latency of 900 ms without any loss of functionality.senhasegura application allows IPV4 and IPV6 protocol support following IETF RFC 2460 specification.Supported protocols and portssenhasegura allows the use of several protocols, through their respective standard ports or any other configured in the solution, for the following operations: remote connections, password changes, Scan Discovery, authentication and web access.Operations are performed based on the ports configured on the device.ConnectivityDefault PortDescriptionHTTP80Web AccessHTTPS443Secure Web AccessLDAP389Scan Discovery / AuthenticationLDAPS636Password Change / Scan / Discovery / AuthenticationMySQL3306Remote Connection* / Password ChangeOracle1521Remote Connection* / Password ChangePostgreeSQL5432Remote Connection* / Password ChangeRDP*3389Remote ConnectionRM HTTP5985Password Change / Scan DiscoveryRM HTTPS5986Password Change / Scan DiscoverySQL Server1433Remote Connection* / Password ChangeSSH22Remote Connection / Password ChangeTelnet23Remote Connection / Password ChangeVNC22Remote Connection / Password ChangeThe supported protocols are only available on TLS1.2 and TLS1.3, once connected to the senhasegura vault.*RemoteApp only**graphical interfacesPerformanceThe senhasegura architecture is designed for maximum performance in all operations performed through the solution.All tests were performed on senhasegura PAM Crypto Appliances with the following configuration:Hardware settingsModel: senhasegura PAM Crypto Appliance TitaniumProcessor: Intel E5-2630v4RAM Memory: 128GBHD: 2x2TB NLSAS RAID1senhasegura settingsCores: 38 vCPUsRAM Memory: 126GBHD: 2TBSSH sessions via senhasegura Terminal ProxyConnectionsCPURAMDISK W5005%10GB4.500 KB/s200020%50GB6.000 KB/s350055%85GB8.000 KB/sSSH sessions via senhasegura Web ProxyConnectionsCPURAMDISK W25010%10GB7.500 KB/s75035%15GB5.000 KB/s125045%20GB2.000 KB/sRDP sessions via senhasegura RDP ProxyConnectionsCPURAMDISK W5005%15GB8.500 KB/s125010%30GB5.000 KB/s200015%50GB2.000 KB/sRDP sessions via senhasegura Web ProxyConnectionsCPURAMDISK W2505%10GB16.000 KB/s100010%20GB9.000 KB/s175020%30GB1.000 KB/sResource limitThe platform senhasegura has some features that are technically limited, either for reasons for database limitations, operating system limitations, file-system limitations or software architecture limitations.The limitations relating to contract or license are fixed by contract, and will not be addressed in this topic.The limitations relating to the number of contracted instances, in a cluster scenario, will also not be addressed in this topic. We will focus on limitations on an instance and its components.User limitTechnically, the application will support up to 16,500,000 user records. This number is shared with WebService A2A users, service users, and actual system users. This number does not express the ability of all these users are using the system simultaneously. Simultaneous use capacity may vary according to the type of use, quantity of contracted instances and network latency supplied.Device limitThe technically application will support up to 16,500,000 device records. This number contains even inactivated devices over time. This number does not express the ability of all these devices are being accessed via proxy, or any other asynchronous process that accesses the device simultaneously. The ability to manage devices can vary by the number of contracted instances, supported systems and protocols and the network latency provided.Credentials limit and protected informationThe application technically will support up to 16,500,000 credential records. This number contains even inactive credentials over time. This number does not express the ability of all these credentials are being accessed and used by asynchronous tasks or proxy sessions simultaneously. The ability to manage credentials can vary by the amount of contracted instances and the network latency provided.Proxy session recordingDifferent from other market solutions, the senhasegura does not perform screen captures in image format, or real-time mp4 videos or other media formats. The real persistence of protocol ensures a faithful and optimized copy of the session. Inactivity times are recorded through 4Bytes timestamp per second, unlike screens capture that would consume much more resources. Native format recording of the protocol already considers the native compression format of the protocol.The session videos are encrypted and stored in a proprietary format and on the same server as the password, with all the standard vault defenses protecting the video's integrity. If the customer wants to apply his own security standards, he can configure the external backup.User behavior will define the amount of sessions that can be stored. Not excluding the possibility of disk expansion or remote storage mapping to increase storage capacity.This combination of factors makes the limit of sessions virtually unlimited. Consider the performance table described in the performance session to calculate your need.Simultaneous proxy sessionsThe amount of simultaneous sessions may vary with the amount of contracted instances, making the solution appropriate to its need without excessive hiring of resources. The cluster architecture also allows the definition of dedicated nodes for specific protocols, or the definition of dedicated instances for different datacenters or network segments. This combination of factors makes the limit of sessions virtually unlimited. Consider the performance table described in the techspec-performance session to calculate your need.senhasegura versioningThe senhasegura versioning nomenclature follows the M.N.P format (eg: 3.22.1-9):Release TypeDescriptionM - MajorIncludes profound architecture and/or technology changes.N - MinorIncludes new features and/or improvements to existing features. Also includes known bug fixes and minor architectural changes.P - PatchIncludes critical bug fixes and security patches. (immediate update recommended)New versions frequency of releasesenhasegura N Updates can vary from 1 to 5 months, depending on the period of the year.As for the available formats, there are two ways:For the new senhasegura environment, can be used the virtual machines available in the partner support.Updates are always available through our repositories, with new releases updated as soon as they become available.Implementation requirementsUse casesFor the correct functioning of the solution, the possible Use Cases must be defined where privileged access management will be performed.Here are some examples of these cases:Active Directory: the Active Directory administrator wants to have remote desktop access (RDP) to Active Directory Server Windows Server 2016 using the “Administrator” user.Databases: the DBA wants to have access to the SQL software client Server Management Studio 2014, which manages SQL database using the local administrator user of the production instance of the “sa” database.Network Assets: the infrastructure administrator requires access to via command line, shell, or console to a Cisco router, via SSH or Telnet port, using the “operator” or “admin” user.Web Applications: access to the portal AWS, using the Cloud Computing administrator account using the account “senhasegura@gmail.com”.Deletion of credentials in hardcore: if you want to eliminate the Database credentials recorded in the source code of an accounting app, change password synchronized in configuration files and services dependent on authentication or provide a connection API for your subscription.Registration of Activities with Generic Users: you desire to obtain a record of activities during any session, including logs of custom audit, look for any command executed by keyboard during the session and on recordings.Segregation of Functions and Segmentation of Functions: you want to create user profiles broken down by denylist lists of commands using the same privileged credential. You want to define groups with privileged access to associated users belonging to the same area.VPNs Optimization: do you want to control and monitor in real-time the access of suppliers and outsourced users to the corporate environment, provide remote access only to specific applications or services on the network for a predetermined time.Cloud Environment Recording: do you want to manage access to cloud applications and ensure user legitimacy that will connect to the same IT governance standards as all other internal network environments.Shared Access: with critical applications whose licensing is very expensive, senhasegura can deliver shared access not-simultaneous from multiple locations for different users making use of the same privileged credential, obtaining information independent and personalized of each session and your recording of video.Repository for Strength Analysis: you can get an analysis of behavior to get metrics, model usage reports, inventory planning, and policy structuring for the efficient use of resources. Online access to session recordings for troubleshooting purposes.Information Protection: do you want to store information with Digital certificates, connection keys, encryption keys, and passwords personal access, with which you can define flows and controls of accesses, which evidences and monitors its use and visualization.Requirements in managed systemsDefine the following information for managed systems:Hostname: hostname of the device. It will be the identifier of queries. (For example, apl001s10 or Facebook).IP Management: device management IP used by the vault for connection. (For example, 192.168.10.1 or facebook.com).Manufacturer: device manufacturer. It will be created if you are not registered. (For example, Microsoft, Oracle).Type: device type. It will be created if you are not registered. (ex: server, Subscription)Model: device model. It will be created if you are not registered.

(For example, Data Center Guatemala).Additional 1: additional Information. (Ex: Platform, Core, Accounting).Additional 2: additional Information. (For example, System, Database, Data, Main Application)Connectivity: device and gateway connectivity, separated by comma and colon. (Ex: RDP: 3389, SSH: 22).Domain: device domain. (For example, domain.com)Privileged account requirementsTo access managed systems, you must have the following information from credentials or privileged accounts:Password type: password policy. (For example, local user Privileged)User: username. (Ex: root)Password: password value. If not filled in, the password is not will update. (For example, Da@lU!83m$1)Domain: domain of the credential. (For example, domain.com)Additional information: additional information on the current credential. Used for DB instances, password changes, or links in general. (For example, ORAC19).Labels: password labels, separated by commas. It is used to group or filter certain credentials.

(Yes or No)Plugin activation: plugin used by activation model. (Per example: Net SSH)Activation model: the model used to perform the activation of the credential. (For example: Enable credentials as root)Plug-in inactivation: plugin used by the inactivation model of the credential. (For example, Net SSH)Inactivation model: template used to perform the inactivation of the credential. (For example: Disabling credentials as root)User for connection: the user used to connect to the equipment and perform status changes and control operations. You can use the same credential. (ex: root or even password)Hostname for connection: hostname used to connect to the device and perform control and status change operations. You can use the same password value. (For example, apl001s10 or Even of the password).Credential owner: user of the credential.Requirements on access groups and usersTo be able to start the senhasegura vault and certain privileged accounts, some access groups must be defined that will allow filtering by segments or groups, the different managed systems, privileged accounts, and privileges to which users who enter the solution must have their own credentials access, and you can create locally in the vault or integrate with an authentication source such as Active Directory, Radius, TACACS or TACACS+, to configure these features:Prerequisites:Number of Access GroupsNames of Access GroupsSystems Privileged by Access GroupsPrivileged Accounts by Access GroupsUsers by Access GroupsOptions by Access Groups (Access to the session and view of the password must be set if you need to enter a reason or get approval.Access limitations by days of the week and time slots (8:00 AM -12:00 PM, 12:00 PM - 16:00 PM, 16:00 PM - 20:00 PM, 20:00 PM - 00:00 AM, 00:00 AM - 04:00 AM, 04:00 AM - 08:00 AM).Example of how to fill in the access group field:Access groupNameSystemPrivileged AccountsUsersOptionsAccess limitationsServersSRV Win 2016 (10.235.x.x)Administratora.martinezonly access to the session without reason or approvalEvery day from 8 am to 5 pmIf there is a growth in the number of users and devices initially defined, the solution must be dimensioned with a gap of 20% to grow without the needing to modify the hardware. If the growth is more significant, it is always possible to scale the solution by integrating it with other hardware with superior capabilities.User profiles in senhaseguraFor the solution to work as intended, it is proposed to have the following access profiles:Administrator: user with greater privileges in the vault, in charge of the configuration activities, modification, and elimination of any configuration, during its operation. It is recommended that there is only one administrator profile and that any activity performed by them is previously documented and authorized.Configurator: user with high privileges in the vault, responsible for privileged account or system modification activities it manages. It is recommended that there are at least two users with a configurator profile and that any action performed by them is previously documented and authorized.Auditor: user only with privileges to view recordings of sessions and their audit logs. There may be multiple users with this profile and may be part of the company’s staff or third parties.User with privileged access: only users with session access to managed systems that use privileged credentials defined in the access group to which the user belongs. As many users as are allowed in the user license can be configured.View of user with a privileged password: user with access to view the password of the privileged account of the managed systems defined by the access group to which the user belongs. As many users as are allowed in the user license can be configured.User with privileged access and view: user with privileged access, login view, a password for managed systems, and privileged credentials defined by the access group to which the user belongs. As many users as allowed can be configured in the user license. There may be multiple users with this profile. They can be part of the company’s staff, applications, or third parties.Example of filling in the user field:UsersNameUsernameDepartmentEmailPhoneAccess groupProfileAlex Martineza.martinezAdministrationalex.m@gmail.com+000 000XXXXServersUser with privileged accessTechnical requirements - Virtual Device - PAMCompatibilityYou can implement senhasegura in virtualized environments. The virtualization assumptions depend on the solution used for deployment and the appliances needed. According to the defined architecture, the compatible environments are as follows:VMware® (ESX/ESXi Server): support ESXi 7.0 and ESXi 6.x (OVA deployment), must use VMXNET3 network adapter driver, plus paravirtualized disk. When performing virtual machine (VM) deployment, the upgrade must be done on the machine’s hardware. Virtual machines can be used in OVA/OVF format.Xen Citrix®: support Citrix Hypervisor 8.2 LTSR, Citrix XenServer 7.0, XenServer 7.1 LTSR, and Xen Project 4.x.x Series (OVA deployment). You must use the HVM generator. RAW format virtual machines can be used.Microsoft® Hyper-V: Support for Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012, and virtual machines in VHD/VHDx format can be used. Azure: Virtual machines in VHD format can be used. AWS: VM in OVA or VMDK structure.Microsoft® Azure (OVA to VHD conversion).Linux KVM(QCOW2).Amazon (Amazon Web Services - AWS) (AMI deployment) (enter account ID and region).Google® Cloud Platform (GCP) (OVA deployment).Openstack: virtual machines in RAW format can be used.Hardware requirementsThese requirements depend on the maximum number of simultaneous sessions handled by the solution and the recording retention time given by each scenario in the different environments, which are defined according to the following information:RDP/SSH: when the access is done by the Terminal Proxy.Web: when the access is done through the browser.The access structure is as follows:NOVPN architecture (optional)  Consumption per connectionHardwareUseRDP/SSHWebCPU: number of Concurrent Connections per core (con./core)Moderate30030RAM: amount of memory used per connection (MB/con.)Moderate2040HDD: disk space by time per connection (kB/s/con.)Moderate34NET: network traffic per connection(Server Side RX / TX)(kbps / con.)Moderate1/345/5NET: network traffic per connection(Client Side RX / TX)(kbps / con.)Moderate0.2/1.010/80For customer deployment, the following features are available for the HA (Two Equal Appliances in Cluster):Up to xxx simultaneous connectionsUsers: xxxManaged Systems: xxHours of use per day: xx hoursDays of use per week: x DaysRetention months: x monthsThe minimum hardware requirements would be as follows:x minimum vCPU (2.0 GHz) (not shared).Minimum RAM x GB (not shared).Minimum DD x TB (Not shared, this requirement directly depends on the required retention).Minimum 1 network port (1 GbE) (not shared).InfoFor a High Availability (Active-Passive) architecture with two members in a cluster, two machines with the exact Hardware requirements are needed. For an (Active-Active) model, a balancer must be added, which is offered separately when necessary.For deployment as disaster recovery, you have the following capabilities for a single device:Up to x simultaneous connectionsUsers: xManaged Systems: xHours of use per day: x hoursDays of use per week: x daysRetention months: x monthsThe minimum hardware requirements would be as follows:Minimum vCPU x CPU (2.0 GHz) (not shared).Minimum RAM x GB (not shared).Minimum DD x TB (not shared, this requirement directly depends on the required retention).Minimum 1 network port (1 GbE) (not shared).
