3. Locate the **Enabled** filter and select **No**. 
4. Click **Filter**.
5. From the list, locate the passwords you want to enable. 
    1. Note that disabled passwords are displayed in **red**.
6. Select the checkboxes next to the passwords you want to enable.

Once enabled, you can perform actions such as viewing, copying, sharing, editing, accessing the version history, and disabling the passwords.
