## Scenario
When a user logs in to Cloud Security, but isn’t active in any tenant, the user won't be able to perform any actions other than just visualizing the home page.

In this scenario, Cloud Security displays an alert at the top of the page with the following message: **Ops! Apparently you don’t belong to any tenant. Reach out your administrator**. 

* * *

## Cause
This issue may occur when the administrator deactivates the user in all the tenants where the user had access.

* * *

## Solution
To solve this issue, ask the tenant's administrator to activate your user in the tenant.
