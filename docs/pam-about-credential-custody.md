Credential escrow in Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems refers to the practice of keeping the credentials used to authenticate access to privileged resources securely and encrypted. This practice helps protect critical information from unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized people can access the credentials needed to perform important tasks on the system.

## My custody on the senhasegura platform

Access the credential custody area of the senhasegura platform from the **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares in the top left corner, and then select **Pam Core**. On the **Credentials** side menu, select the **My Custody** option.

The credentials the user in question has custody of will be listed on the main page.

:::(Info) (Info)
To obtain custody of a credential, the user simply needs to view the password via the password list on the senhasegura platform. This custody will be used to release access and allow other users to access that credential.
:::

Password custody is organized according to the device to which the credential is linked (For example: `AWS`, `100.66.120.101`, among others). To find out more about devices in the context of senhasegura, go to the documentation about **Devices**. To find out more about credentials, go to the **Credentials** documentation.
