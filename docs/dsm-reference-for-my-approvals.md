:::(info) (Info)
In cases where level approvals are being used, note that if the configuration is set to one approval, one approval per level is required. For example, if a group is registered up to level 2, one approval is required for level 1 and another for level 2. Similarly, if the group is registered up to level 3, it must obtain approvals from levels 1, 2, and 3. Each registration level requires a corresponding approval.
