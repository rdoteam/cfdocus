The senhasegura platform allows you to register different types of devices from different manufacturers, each with its own specialty and use. This type of registration makes it easier to identify your devices, since you can organize them into categories.

:::(Info) (Info)

In addition to the list of devices offered by senhasegura, it’s also possible to create new types of devices to meet your business needs.

:::

## Devices are classified by:

- Model.
- Type.
- Vendor.

:::(Info) (Info)

In both, **Connectivity** and **Logs**, registering new elements won’t be possible. Thus, the only possible operation is to *issue, download and schedule reports*. To learn how to perform these operations, access the documentation on [How to issue, download and schedule device reports](/v3-32/docs/general-information-how-to-issue-download-and-schedule-device-reports).
