The integration of senhasegura with the IGA One Identity Manager solution aims to centralize the control and release of accesses. Based on the concept of Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), it unifies privileged information, mitigating the risks related to the authorization of users to enter different environments with greater control of identity expansion and, consequently, strengthening the cybersecurity posture.

For this, it is necessary to configure the solution:
