2. In the top left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, indicated by the nine-square box, and select **Domum Remote Access**.
3. On the side menu, select **Settings > Parameters**.
4. Select **Domum**.
5. In **Automatically grant access on Internal user provisioning***, choose **Yes**.
6. Set the **Duration** of access and select **Minutes, Hours, Days**, or **Months**.
    :::(Info) (Info)
   If you don't want a specific group to follow the global settings for automatic sending, you can specify unique settings when creating or editing an [internal user group](/v3-32/docs/domum-new-internal-users-group-add-update-form).
    :::
7. Continue configuring the [initial parameters](/v3-32/docs/domum-how-to-set-the-parameters) according to your preferences.

A pop-up window will display a confirmation message indicating the conclusion of the process. You’ve just set the necessary parameters for sending the access link automatically. Once provisioning is complete, **Domum Remote Access** will send the link to internal users.
