Once you've installed **senhasegura Load Balancer**, you must configure it within the senhasegura vault. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. First, you need to create a network subinterface. To do this, open the subinterface configuration file by typing the command below:

```bash
vim /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0:1
```

2. In the configuration file, you must create the rules and properties for this subinterface. To do this, enter the information below:

```bash
 auto eth0:1
 iface eth0:1 inet static
 	address <VIP_IP_ADDRESS>
 	netmask 255.255.255.255
 	pre-up arptables -t filter -F INPUT
 	pre-up arptables -t filter -F OUTPUT
 	pre-up arptables -t filter -A INPUT -d <VIP_IP_ADDRESS> -j DROP
 	post-up arptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -s <VIP_IP_ADDRESS> -j mangle --mangle-ip-s <IP_DA_ETH0_DO_SERVIDOR>
```

3. In the file, you'll notice two variables related to the environment you're configuring. So pay attention to these variables:
    1. `<VIP_IP_ADDRESS>` must be replaced by the same VIP address configured when installing the load balancer.
    2. `<IP_DA_ETH0_DO_SERVIDOR>`, which must be replaced by the IP address of the senhasegura vault's network interface.
4. Save and close the file with the `:wq!` command.
5. With the configuration file created, you'll need to apply the settings. To do this, run the command:

```bash
ifup eth0:1
```

6. Validate the IP address configuration with the following command:

```bash
ip a
```

The command output should look like below:

```bash
1: 	lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
	link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
	inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
		valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

2: 	eth0: <BROADCAST,NULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
	link/ether 08:00:27:b3:b8:dc brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	inet 192.168.1.15/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0
		valid_lft 82768sec preferred_lft 82768sec
	inet 192.168.1.200/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global secondary eth0:1
		valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

:::(info) (Info)
Once the configuration is complete, the vault's license will expire and must be renewed.
