Once you have set up your JIT credential, you can access it by following the steps below:

1. In the top left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Credentials > Just In Time (JIT)**.
3. In the list, identify the previously configured JIT credential and click **Start session**, represented by the computer icon.
4. A new window or tab will open in your browser with the following message: **Connected to senhasegura. Provisioning the credential on the device.**
5. In case of success, you'll be redirected to the session on the configured device.
6. Otherwise, an error message will indicate that access couldn’t be provisioned with the following message: An error occurred while provisioning the credential.

:::(Warning) (Warning)
- When using the **Enable/Disable** credential mode, the credential to which the configuration is being made will be the target of the enable and disable template. In this case, use another credential to authenticate yourself at the JIT stage.
- When using the **Credential creation and deletion** mode, the credential where the JIT is being configured won't be the target of the template. A new dynamic credential will be created on the target device using the `senseg9999999` pattern (senseg prefix followed by 7 digits). In this case, the credential itself can be used to authenticate itself on the target device.
