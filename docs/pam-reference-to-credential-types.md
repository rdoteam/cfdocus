To search for the different types of credentials registered, click on the **Show filters** button, identified by the magnifying glass icon in the top bar.

## Search fields

The following fields are part of the search components.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Registration code for the type of credential. |
| Name | Name of the credential type. |
| Local user? | A drop-down menu with **Yes** and **No** options. Local users are those who can't log in to domains. |
