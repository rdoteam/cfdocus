    1. ```ssh mt4adm@ -p 59022```
    2. Press **Enter**.
2. At the **warning**, type:
    1. ```yes```
    2. Press **Enter**.
3. Type the **password**:
    1. In the first access, the password is **mt4adm**.
    2. Press **Enter**.
    3. Then change the password to a personal one.
    4. Press **Enter**.
    :::(Error) (**Caution**)
    With your personal password created after the first access, only this password will give you access to the vault. **Don’t forget this password**, the loss of it results in permanent loss of access to the vault.
