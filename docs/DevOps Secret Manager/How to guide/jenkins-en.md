# How to integrate DSM with Jenkins

## About Jenkins and integration with DSM CLI

Jenkins has a feature that allows environment variables to be set during job execution and stored safely for later use. However, administrators must ensure that these variables are rotated regularly without interrupting the DevOps pipeline.

senhasegura DSM has a Jenkins plugin that uses the platform's native architecture to set environment variables during pipeline runtime. This plugin also sends all the variables available in the working environment to senhasegura DSM to discover any sensitive data that is running unnoticed, helping system administrators to have greater control over their systems.

The image below shows a diagram of how DSM and Jenkins are integrated:

## Integrate DSM with Jenkins

senhasegura DSM provides a native integration so that Jenkins jobs can fetch secrets directly from senhasegura, thus providing an easy way to configure secret injection.

To install the senhasegura Jenkins integration using the .hpi file, follow the steps below:

1. Access your Jenkins instance.
2. On the home page, click the **Manage Jenkins** option in the side menu.
3. Click the **Manage Plugins** option.
4. On the **Advanced tab**, in the **Upload Plugin** section, click the **Upload button** and upload the `.hpi` file.
5. To complete the installation, restart Jenkins.

:::danger Caution

* The integration of senhasegura with Jenkins is only available for Jenkins 2.235.1 or more recent versions.
* Ensure you select OAuth 2.0 as the authentication method in senhasegura DSM, as the plugin uses it to fetch information.

## Configure integration with Jenkins

Once the plugin is installed, follow the instructions below:

1. Create a new job or select an existing one.
2. In the side menu, click on **Configure**.
3. Scroll to the **Build Environment** section and select the **senhasegura** **DSM Plugin** checkbox.
4. In the s**enhasegura URL** field, enter the URL used to access the senhasegura instance.
5. Click the **Add** button to create a new Jenkins credential.
6. In the open window, select **senhasegura Auth Credential**.
7. Fill in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields with the data provided by DSM.
8. Optionally, provide an ID and a description and click the **Add** button.
9. In the **senhasegura** **Auth Credential** field, select the credential created in the previous step.

## Inject secrets using Jenkins

After setting up the integration in the project, go to the **Build Now** menu to run the pipeline and use the secrets. When the job is finished, click **Job ID > Console** to display the execution result.

The execution result will look like the one below:

```
