# How to configure authenticators in senhasegura DevOps Secret Manager

:::tip Info
Although not recommended, it's possible to not include authenticators in your DSM application.

## How to configure OAuth 1.0

OAuth 1.0 is an authentication method that uses four tokens to identify and authorize access to an application. When opting for OAuth 1.0, it's crucial to choose `HMAC-SHA1` as the signature method and 1.0 as the version. The `Timestamp`, `Nonce`, and `Signature` items are mandatory and must be provided.

To use this authentication method, access **Grid Menu &gt; DevOps Secret Manager &gt; Applications &gt; Applications** and follow these steps:

1. Edit or create an application.
2. Select OAuth 1.0 as the authentication method.
3. Provide the required data in case of a new application as mentioned in the Applications document.
4. Click **Save**.

:::(warning) (Attention)
To ensure data integrity, always use a modern authentication method. senhasegura advises against using OAuth 1.0 due to its outdated security measures and recommends updating legacy applications to support modern authentication methods.

## How to configure OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authentication method that requires a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret` to obtain a token that allows access to senhasegura resources for a limited time. When using OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

To use this authentication method, access **Grid Menu &gt; DevOps Secret Manager &gt; Applications &gt; Applications** and follow these steps:

1. Edit or create an application.
2. Select OAuth 2.0 as the authentication method.
3. Provide the required data in case of a new application as mentioned in the Applications document.
4. Click **Save**.

:::tip Info
For OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0, when a resource needs to access a secret, it can use its OAuth 1.0/OAuth 2.0 tokens to request information from senhasegura. If the data is valid, senhasegura will allow the application to interact with the DSM's secrets and authorizations.

## How to set up the AWS authenticator

Using AWS as the authentication method allows applications to retrieve stored data using the `AWS Access Keys ID` and `Secret Access Keys` with a unique key generated by senhasegura DSM.

To use this authentication method, access **Grid Menu &gt; DevOps Secret Manager &gt; Applications &gt; Applications** and follow these steps:

1. Edit or create an application.
2. Select AWS as the authentication method.
3. Provide the required data in case of a new application as mentioned in the Applications document.
4. In the **Amazon AWS ARN** section, provide a valid credential ARN.
5. Click **Save**.

The AWS ARN, or Amazon Resource Name, is a unique identifier assigned to resources within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. This identifier is used to accurately and securely identify and access resources on the AWS platform. The ARN comprises multiple fields that provide detailed information about the associated resource. The general structure of an ARN is as follows: `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id`, where each field refers to:

* `arn`: a fixed number that indicates that it's an Amazon Resource Name.
* `partition`: represents the AWS partition where the resource is located.
* `service`: indicates the AWS service to which the resource belongs.
* `region`: specifies the geographical region in which the resource is located.
* `account-id`: uniquely identifies the AWS account that owns the resource.
* `resource-type`: identifies the specific resource within the service.
* `resource-id`: identifies the resource. Indicates the name, ID, or resource path.

:::tip Info
It's possible for the AWS ARN to have only `resource-type`, only `resource-id`, or both. When it has both values, it will be presented as: `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id`.
:::

To access sensitive data, a resource can request access using its `AWS Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, and a `unique key` generated by senhasegura DSM. This request is sent to senhasegura to verify whether the information provided matches the AWS ARNs configured in the application. Once the match is confirmed, senhasegura DSM grants the application authorization to access the secrets.

:::tip Info
The DSM uses Programmatic Access to verify that the information provided is valid. For more information on how to generate AWS Access Keys, [access the AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys).
