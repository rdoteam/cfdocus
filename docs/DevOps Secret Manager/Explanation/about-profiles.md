# About profiles on dynamic provisioning

Dynamic provisioning profiles are pre-configured settings that allow senhasegura DSM to automate the creation and management of access credentials. These profiles can be used in cloud environments, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and on local systems and devices such as databases and Linux/Windows servers. By following an organization's security and compliance policies, these profiles determine how credentials are generated, managed, and removed.

Each dynamic provisioning profile contains specific information such as an identifier that helps with easy identification, whether the profile is active, the cloud provider or system type with which the profile is associated, a detailed profile description, and additional settings such as TTL (time to live) of the related credentials and permissions.

Profiles play a crucial role in automated credential management. They enable organizations to control who has access to which resources and for how long and facilitate credential rotation, allowing for consistent security.
