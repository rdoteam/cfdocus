# About the dynamic provisioning

The dynamic provisioning streamlines the creation, administration, and de-provisioning of critical data in IT settings, including cloud infrastructures and diverse systems. Senhasegura DSM leverages this process to generate and oversee secrets securely and efficiently. This approach guarantees that each application or service accesses exclusive credentials for a designated period.

This approach proves advantageous in fluid, ever-evolving setups like Kubernetes and OpenShift, where each Pod can obtain specific credentials for interfacing with databases and cloud services. This bolsters the prevention of secret sharing and minimizes the risk of sensitive data exposure. Moreover, senhasegura DSM can withdraw connected secrets upon Pod deletion, preserving the environment's security with no manual interaction.
