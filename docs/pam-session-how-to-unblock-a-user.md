## Unblock a user

1. At the senhasegura platform, in the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **PAM Core**.
2. On the side menu, select **Access control** >  **Blocked users**.
3. On the list, choose the user that you want to unblock.
4. At the **Action** column, click on the icon represented by a **padlock** (Block/Release interactivity).
5. At the confirmation box, click **Yes** to confirm the action.

A message will be displayed **“Interactivity restored. User may interact with the session!”**. The block entry is removed from the active block list.

To find the registers from the previously unblocked users, go to the **Status** field and select **Disable**. On the list will be displayed all the unblocked users.
