## Notifications

The purpose of the Notifications module is to manage ***notifications*** sent through senhasegura . Some actions performed on senhasegura can be configured to send notifications to chosen ***users*** to reporting about a change or an alert.

These notifications can be an ***error***, ***certificate expiration*** or an ***access request***. Administrators can know what is happening on the system and be aware of any suspicious behavior or error occurred.

The senhasegura allows the notifications to be sent through email, SMS or screen, it can be organized by type and you can also choose which ***users*** will receive that type of notification.
