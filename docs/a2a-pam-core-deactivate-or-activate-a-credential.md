This value is automatically assigned by senhasegura when [creating a credential](/v3-32/docs/a2a-pam-core-create-or-update-a-credential) and is obtained in the response to the [List all credentials](/v3-32/docs/a2a-pam-core-list-credentials) request. | 5     |

#### Return

        "error_code": 0,

        "cod_erro": 0
    }
}

#### Second endpoint

`/iso/pam/credential/[username@hostname]`

#### Request parameters

**Path**

| Field | Type   | Required | Description                           | Example |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `username@hostname`    | Int | Yes      | Credential’s associated `username` and `hostname` separated by the @ symbol.
