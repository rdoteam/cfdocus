### Path to access
There are two ways to access the **Devices** configuration area. Follow one of these paths:

1. **Quick actions menu**: click the **Quick actions** icon, represented by a sheet of paper with the sum sign, and select Device.

or

1. In the upper left corner of the senhasegura platform, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **Devices**.
2. On the side menu, select **Devices**.
3. Click the **View Actions** icon, represented by the three vertical dots, and click **+ New**.

Both actions will open a new pop-up window with the device registration form. Fill in the following data to configure the new device:

## Add a device

1. Register a device with the following data according to the values in the table above:
    1. On the tab **Information**, fill in the mandatory fields with the asterisk:
        1. **IP, hostname, or management URL**: type the information in which the device is registered.
        2. **Device name**: name that will be used to identify the device.
        3. **Device type**: choose Database.
        4. **Vendor**: choose the database vendor.
        5. **Product**: choose the database model.
        6. **Site**: select the option to which the database belongs.
        7. **Tags**: add the desired tags.
    2. On the tab **Connectivity**, fill in:
        1. **Connectivity**: choose the connectivity to be used.
        2. **Port**: the default number is automatically filled in. If you use a number other than the suggested port, make the change.
        3. Click **Save**.
        4. Click **Test** to confirm the connectivity.
2. Click **Save**.

The platform will display the confirmation notice. Once the configuration is finished, it’s important to set up a credential for this device. Access the [Credentials](/v3-32/docs/pam-credentials) documentation to know how to perform it.

:::(warning) (**Caution**)
For Oracle device type, the credentials set up is done in a different way. To know how to register this type of credential, access the [How to configure a credential on senhasegura to use at Oracle Database Proxy](/v3-32/docs/pam-session-how-to-configure-a-credential-in-senhasegura-to-use-database-proxy-with-oracle).
