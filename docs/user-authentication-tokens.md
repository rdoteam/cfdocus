In this article, we’ll introduce all the essential information about the User Authentication Tokens page. This page allows you to easily view and manage your stored tokens, including the option to delete them when needed.

## Authentication via token
Tokens serve as credentials that verify user identity and authorize access to protected resources. Instead of transmitting sensitive credentials on each request, the client securely stores the token and sends it in subsequent interactions, enhancing overall security.

Authentication tokens ensure sensitive information remains protected while users can have a more streamlined experience.
