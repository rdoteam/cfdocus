This article contains detailed information about the **MySafe** homepage.

## Welcome to the MySafe homepage

**MySafe**'s welcome page presents four centralized shortcuts to its primary functions upon your first access. Clicking on them will direct you to the corresponding screens:

- [Add password](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-passwords-add)
- [Add file](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-files-add)
- [Add note](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-notes-add)
- [Add API secret](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-api-secret-add)

Below the shortcuts, you'll find the link **[Need help?](/v3-32/docs/mysafe)** which takes you to the documentation platform.

## After the first access

After the first addition, you can access the main functions by clicking on **+ Add password**, in the drop-down menu located at the upper right side of the screen.


In the center of the screen, you’ll find shortcuts to the most commonly used features. 
At the bottom, there is the **Find an item** search bar to search by *passwords, file names, note names, API secrets, tags, URL,* or *owners*.
