In this article, you will find a step-by-step guide on how to register a command to be audited in a remote session.

Audited commands allow segmentation at the **Global**, **Access group**, **Device**, and **Credential** levels. The difference is that there will be no overlapping of a command based on the chain of segregating entities. It’s a sum of rules, a possibility to isolate commands belonging to certain credentials and devices from a certain manufacturer.


:::(warning) (**Caution**)
The audited commands functionality **isn't** available for **RDP Proxy** for security reasons. To use it, access our content on filtering RDP commands for PowerShell and CMD on senhasegura.go

## Register a command
:::(warning) (**Caution**)
Registered audited commands are loaded at the beginning of each session. If a session is already active and a new command is registered, it will not affect the already started session.
:::

1. On the senhasegura platform, in the top left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Settings** > **Access** > **Audited commands**.
3. In the upper right corner, click on the icon represented by the **three vertical dots**.
    1. Choose one of the options to add a new command.

#### New global command

1. On the **Global command** screen, fill in the mandatory fields identified by the asterisk.
2. In the **Command** tab, fill in:
    1. **Name***: name to identify the command to be audited.
    2. **Session type***: select the type of session that will have the command audited, and choose from the options **All**, **Terminal Proxy**, or **Database Proxy**.
        :::(info) (**Info**)
        The option **Terminal** includes any session of the type **SSH** and **Telnet** that is accessed through a session **Web Proxy** and/or sessions accessed through **Terminal Proxy**.
        :::
    3. **Criticality***: level of criticality that the command will have, choose between the options **Low**, **Medium** and **High**.
    4. **Action during session***: the action that will occur when carrying out the command. Choose between the options **Allow execution**, **Deny execution**, **Interrupt session** and **Force**.
        :::(warning) (**Caution**)
        Only when the value **Interrupt session** is set on the **Action during session** field, the user will have their session terminated immediately. Otherwise, the user will be able to continue with their active session, and only after disconnecting and reconnecting will the authentication fail.
        :::
    5. **Occurrences (minimum)**: the number of times the command can occur until the action is performed. Choose between 1 and 10.
    6. **Block and disable user?**: option could be enabled when the action is Deny execution or Interrupt session. Choose between options Yes or No.
    7. **Command***: writes the regular expression of the command to be audited according to the rule.
        :::(info) (**Info**)
        The use of the asterisk * to capture all executed commands will not work. Commands must be fully specified. Ex.: update public\.table name*
        :::
    8. **Description***: describe the command being registered.
3. Click **Save**.

#### New command by credential

1. On the **Command by credential** screen, fill in the fields described in the **Command tab**, as the example above.
2. On the **Credentials tab**:
    1. Click on the **plus** sign and select the credentials that will be audited by this command.
    2. Click **Add**.
3. Click **Save**.

#### New command by device

1. On the screen **Command by device**, fill in the fields described in the **Command tab**, as the example above.
2. On the **Device** tab:
    1. Click on the **plus** sign and select the devices that will be audited by this command.
    2. Click **Add**.
3. Click **Save**.

#### New command by group

1. On the screen **Command by group**, fill in the fields described in the **Command tab**, as the example above.
2. On the **Groups** tab:
    1. Click on the **plus** sign and select the groups that will be audited by this command.
    2. Click **Add**.
3. Click **Save**.

The system displays a message confirming the command registration. All sessions started after this registration will have tracking of these commands. With each use of a registered audited command, senhasegura displays the message “**Auditing command. Please wait…**” and these commands will be displayed in the **Event Log** report.


:::(info) (**Info**)
If no command is registered, the senhasegura platform will display only the beginning and end of the session in its **Event Log** report.
