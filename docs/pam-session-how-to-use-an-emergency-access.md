This article will guide you through a step-by-step on how to use emergency access to view a credential password.

It’s a case in which the requester can skip the approval process if there is a need for immediate emergency use of the credential.
When the access group allows the requester to use this feature, the user will be presented with the emergency access screen right after sending the access request.

:::(info) (**Info**)
As soon as the requester confirms emergency access, senhasegura will send all approvers the information to which the requester had previous access. The access request will be marked with **emergency use**.
