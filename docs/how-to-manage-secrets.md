#### Important

* When the information expires, it's deleted. However, some information, such as access keys, can no longer be recovered.
* Only PAM Core or Cloud IAM access group users can add cloud credentials and credentials for registering a secret.

* PAM Core manages credentials.
* **Ephemeral Credentials** are provisioned by senhasegura directly at the destination via **Dynamic provisioning**. Once the credential has been rotated, the **DSM** won't delete the old **Cloud credentials** and **Ephemeral Credentials** information.
