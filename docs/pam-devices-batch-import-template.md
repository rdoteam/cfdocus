The batch import functionality is essential to speed up the creation of a set of devices and credentials in senhasegura. In this guide, you’ll learn how to download the template file in `.xlsx` format, which contains all the necessary information for importing devices and credentials.

## Important information

When using batch import, it’s important to be aware of the following information:

* Imported spreadsheets are registered in senhasegura and can be retrieved later if needed.
* Devices and credentials included in the spreadsheet, that don’t already exist in senhasegura, will be created during the import process.
* Devices and credentials already registered in senhasegura will be updated according to the information provided in the import spreadsheet.
* In case a wrong import occurs, the fastest way to undo it's to correct the spreadsheet and import it again.

:::(Info) (Info)
For optimal server performance, it's recommended not importing templates over a thousand units, or that may consume excessive resources.
