# ⚙ Changelog per module

## PAM - Credential Management

### Bug Fixes
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 2275 | Fixed an issue causing automatic policy rollback when creating a credential policy based on tags and assigning the corresponding tag to the credential. Now, upon adding the tag to the credential, the created policy is permanently applied, ensuring consistency in the application of tag-based credential policies without undesired fallbacks to lower-level policies shortly after creation. |
| 1063 | Fixed an issue where, when creating a new notification to send by e-mail at login, the option Send notifications only to contacts with access to credentials and device was not respected. |
| 1979 | Fixed an issue where the Local User credential was not retaining the new policy when a password strength and credential type policy were applied using the Default policy. This caused the credential to persist with the Default policy instead of adopting the newly assigned one. |
| 2186 | Fixed an issue in which the embedded Mozilla Firefox browser made requests to URLs outside of senhasegura's domain. |

### Product Updates
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1115 | Removed the Key Path field from the SSH Key form, as it's no longer necessary with the system now automatically generating private keys. This enhancement streamlines the key creation process by eliminating the need for manual key path input. |
| 1125 | From now on, administrators will only receive email notifications when SSH credential/key password exchanges fail. The notification email includes a list of affected devices. |

### Translation Fix
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1116 | The label Renew the key without setting a password? has been changed to Renew the key and set a password? The new label has been applied to all instances where it appears. The modification of the label doesn't affect the functionality of key renewal. As a result of this change, the default value for this field is now Yes. |

## PAM - Session Management

### Bug Fixes
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 2527 | Fixed the error where Database Proxy sessions weren't marked as closed even after disconnecting from the client. |

| 607 | Implemented support for authentication via Kerberos for RDP Gate and RDP via Web Proxy sessions. |
| 119 | The Enable file transfer field was divided, in System Parameters and Segregated Parameters, between Enable file transfer for download and Enable file transfer for upload. |
| 991 | Support for the RSA_SHA2_256 and RSA_SHA2_512 algorithms has been implemented for web proxy and terminal proxy connections. |
