## Introduction

The senhasegura **Certificate Manager** provide centralized management of the digital certificate lifecycle within the organization, from Discovery through automatic scanning of websites, directories and web servers, to automated Certificate renewal through external or internal Certificate Authorities.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for users using Certificate Manager administrator roles, and to discuss details about their use, benefits, concepts, and procedures.

### How the Certificate Manager works

senhasegura Certificate Manager manages the entire digital Certificate lifecycle, working with Certificate through request generation, manual importation of existing Certificates, or Discovery of Certificates across Devices, Domains or Containers. In addition to monitoring certificate validity and facilitating renewal, Certificate Manager also allows you to view logs and reports on all operations performed through the solution.

### Definitions

The senhasegura uses specific terminology for its functions and features. Thus, some terms must be understood before starting to use the solution:

-   **User:** Own employees, interns or third parties who use or may need access to company systems;

-   **Digital Certificate:** Digital certificates are files that contain public and private key information that is used for secure communication over the Internet, as well as to certify the sender's authenticity

-   **Certification Authority:** Certification Authority is an entity duly registered with the responsible bodies and which has the function of issuing digital certificates.

### Activities

In this section, the following senhasegura functions will be covered: make requests, receive answers and senhasegura Certificate Manager method.

## Method

The senhasegura integration webservice has some methods to query, create or change information stored in the application.
