Customers with versions prior to 3.29 of senhasegura who wish to update to version 3.29 or later must follow the instructions provided in this article.

## Requirements


* Your [firewall rules](/v3-32/docs/installation-firewall-rules) must allow communication with senhasegura repositories.
* Set the correct server time.
* The Arbitrator must be removed from the cluster (only for environments with an Arbitrator).
* Take a snapshot before the update.

:::(Warning) (Application unavailable during update)
When senhasegura initiates the update process, it will be unavailable until the activity is complete.
:::

* * *

## Take a snapshot

Snapshots should be taken only when senhasegura instances are offline. This ensures the ability to revert to a previous version if necessary.

1. You can shut down a senhasegura instance using the following command:
```Shell
sudo orbit shutdown
```
2. Once the instance is completely shut down, take a snapshot in the hypervisor. 
3. Reboot your senhasegura instance and update the application.
