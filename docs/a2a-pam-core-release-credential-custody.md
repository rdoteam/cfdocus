## Metadata_End
This document presents how to release the custody of a credential registered in **PAM Core** via API, the available endpoints, the parameters needed, example requests, and expected responses on success or in case of errors.


## Methods

### `DELETE` Release the custody of a credential
When the API receives a password request, we refer to it as granting the user temporary custody of the corresponding credential. When the API revokes access to this credential, we describe it as releasing custody.

`/iso/pam/credential/custody/[id]`
