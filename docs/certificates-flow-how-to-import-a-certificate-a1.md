## Import a certificate
:::(info) (**Types of certificates**)
You can manually add a variety of certificate types, including `.p12`, `.pem`, `.cer`, `.der`, `.crt`, `.p7b` and `.pfx` (Private key included, no need to import the key).
:::
To manually import a certificate, follow these steps:

1. On the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Certificate Manager**.
2. From the left side menu, select **Certificates A1**.
3. In the top right corner, click the three vertical dots icon.
4. From the dropdown menu, select **Import new certificate A1**.
5. Choose a **Certificate file** from your machine. This is the only mandatory field.
6. If your certificate has a separate key file, also select the corresponding **Key file**.
7. If you'd like your certificate to have a password for the key, enter it in the **Key password** field while you're importing it. You won't be able to add this information later.
    :::(warning) (**Caution**)
    Although adding a **Revocation password** isn't mandatory, it's highly recommended. Certificates lacking this password can be revoked unintentionally by anyone with access to the CA.
    :::
    :::(info) (**Info**)
    Both passwords can be up to 72 characters long, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the symbols `! % @ # ^ * _ `.
    :::
8. If you prefer, insert the information from the certificate you are importing into an existing one. Click the **Use as information for an existing certificate** field and wait a moment for senhasegura to display the certificate, and you can select it.
    1. Select the desired certificate.
9. Click **Save** to confirm the import.

On the **Certificates A1** page, you'll see the certificate you just imported.
