::: (error) (Important)
If you’re using a version prior to 3.29 and wish to update senhasegura to version 3.29 or later, please refer to the article [How to update versions prior to 3.29](/v3-32/docs/installation-how-to-update-versions-prior-to-329).

::: (error) (Important)
If you use Zabbix, it will be necessary to reconfigure it after updating senhasegura to version 3.30 via Orbit Command Line Interface (CLI). For instructions on how to configure Zabbix via Orbit CLI, refer to the article [How to configure Zabbix via Orbit CLI](/v3-32/docs/orbit-cli-how-to-configure-zabbix-via-orbit-cli).

In this article, you’ll find a guide on how to update senhasegura online. 

## Requirements


* Your [firewall rules](/v3-32/docs/installation-firewall-rules) must allow communication with senhasegura repositories.
* Set the correct server time.
* The Arbitrator must be removed from the cluster (only for environments with an Arbitrator).
* Take a snapshot before the update.

:::(Warning) (Application unavailable during update)
When senhasegura initiates the update process, it will be unavailable until the activity is complete.
:::

* * *

## Take a snapshot

Snapshots should be taken only when senhasegura instances are offline. This ensures the ability to revert to a previous version if necessary.

1. You can shut down a senhasegura instance using the following command:
```Shell
sudo orbit shutdown
```
2. Once the instance is completely shut down, take a snapshot in the hypervisor. 
3. Reboot your senhasegura instance and update the application.
