7. Fill in the spreadsheet with the required information.
8. Save the file.
9. **Drag and drop** the file into the rectangle or click **Browse file**.
10. Click **Save**.

After submitting the spreadsheet, you can track the status of the batch import on the home page. The **Status** field will initially be set as **Waiting**. If the import is successful, the **Status** field will change to **Finished** and your passwords will be viewable on the **Passwords** homepage. 

However, if the import is not successful, the **Status** field will change to **Error processing**, and your passwords will not be imported. In this case, you can review the Process Details screen to identify the error.
