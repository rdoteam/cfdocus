## Revoke an access key authorization

1. On senhasegura, in the upper left corner, click the** Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **MySafe**.
2. In the side menu, select **+ Integrations > Access keys**.
3. From the list, locate the access key authorization you want to revoke.
4. In the **Action** column, click the three vertical dots icon.
5. In the drop-down menu, select **Revoke**, represented by a trash can icon.
6. A confirmation pop-up question similar to the following one is displayed: 

**“Are you sure you want to revoke Test?” **

7. Click **Yes** to confirm.

A pop-up window with the message **“API authorization successfully revoked”** confirms the action. Below the message, click **Close** to close the window.

Once revoked, the authorization won’t be displayed in the report anymore and won’t be available for use. If you want the same authorization, you’ll have to add it again.
